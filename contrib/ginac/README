General Information
===================

GiNaC (which stands for "GiNaC is Not a CAS" (computer algebra system)) is a
C++ library for symbolic mathematical calculations.  It is designed to allow
the creation of integrated systems that embed symbolic manipulations together
with more established areas of computer science (like computation-intense
numeric applications, graphical interfaces, etc.) under one roof.
