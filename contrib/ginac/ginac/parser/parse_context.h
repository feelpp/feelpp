 * function (or class) corresponds to the given name and has the given
 * number of the arguments.
 *
 * N.B.
 *
 * 1. The function don't have to return a (GiNaC) function or class, it
 *    can return any expression.
 * 2. Overloaded functions/ctors are paritally supported, i.e. there might
 *    be several functions with the same name, but they should take different
 *    number of arguments.
 * 3. User can extend the parser via custom prototype tables. It's possible
 *    to read user defined classes, create abbreviations, etc.
 *
 * NOTE: due to a hack that allows user defined functions to be parsed, the map
 *       value of type reader_func is internally treated as an unsigned and not as a
 *       function pointer!! The unsigned has to correspond to the serial number of
 *       the defined GiNaC function.
