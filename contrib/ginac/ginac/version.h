// GiNaC library version information. It has very little to do with GiNaC
// version number. In particular, library version is OS dependent. 
//
// When making releases, do
// 1. Increment GINAC_LT_REVISION
// 2. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
//    release, increment GINAC_LT_CURRENT and set GINAC_LT_REVISION to 0.
// 3. If any interfaces have been added since the last release, increment
//    GINAC_LT_AGE.
// 4. If any interfaces have been removed since the last release, set 
//    GINAC_LT_AGE to 0.
//
// Please note: the libtool naming scheme cannot guarantee that on all
// systems, the numbering is consecutive. It only guarantees that it is
// increasing. This doesn't matter, though: there is not incurred cost
// for numbers that are omitted, except for shrinking the available space
// of leftover numbers. Not something we need to worry about yet. ;-)

/*
 * GiNaC archive file version information.
 *
 * The current archive version is GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_VERSION. This is
 * the version of archives created by the current version of GiNaC.
 * Archives version (GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_VERSION - GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_AGE)
 * thru * GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_VERSION can be read by current version
 * of GiNaC.
 *
 * Backward compatibility notes:
 * If new properties have been added:
 *	GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_VERSION += 1
 *	GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_AGE += 1
 * If backwards compatibility has been broken, i.e. some properties
 * has been removed, or their type and/or meaning changed:
 *	GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_VERSION += 1
 *	GINACLIB_ARCHIVE_AGE = 0
