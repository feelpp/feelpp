/** The remember table is organized like an n-fold associative cache
 *  in a microprocessor.  The table has a width of 's' (which is rounded
 *  to table_size, some power of 2 near 's', internally) and a depth of 'as'
 *  (unless you choose that entries are never discarded). The place where
 *  an entry is stored depends on the hashvalue of the parameters of the
 *  function (this corresponds to the address of byte to be cached).
 *  The 'log_2(table_size)' least significant bits of this hashvalue
 *  give the slot in which the entry will be stored or looked up.
 *  Each slot can take up to 'as' entries. If a slot is full, an older
 *  entry is removed by one of the following strategies:
 *   - oldest entry (the first one in the list)
 *   - least recently used (the one with the lowest 'last_access')
 *   - least frequently used (the one with the lowest 'successful_hits')
 *  or all entries are kept which means that the table grows indefinitely. */
