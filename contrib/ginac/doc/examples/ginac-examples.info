GiNaC Examples
**************

This is a collection of code examples using GiNaC.

1 Input / Output
****************

1.1 Archiving expressions (source) (archive1.cpp)
=================================================

Two expression are stored in an archive on the disk and are restored
again.

1.2 Input and output of expressions
===================================

1.2.1 Expression input (source) (derivative.cpp)
------------------------------------------------

Interactively input expression and compute its derivative with respect
to the "x" variable.

2 Monte Carlo Integration
*************************

2.1 Example showing compile_ex (source) (compile1.cpp)
======================================================

Simple example showing compile_ex with one free variable.  Timing
between CLN and C double numerics is done.

2.2 Using VEGAS from CUBA (source) (compile2.cpp)
=================================================

An expression in two variables is integrated by using VEGAS from the
CUBA library (http://www.feynarts.de/cuba/).

2.3 Example showing link_ex (source) (compile3.cpp)
===================================================

Demonstrates the use of link_ex.  Program has to be called more than
once to see the effect.

3 Lanczos Approximation
***********************

The program lanczos.cpp calculates coefficients for use in the Lanczos
approximation of the gamma function.  The Lanczos approximation is used
by the function inside GiNaC that approximates the gamma function
numerically.  See the comments in the source file for more information.
