1 Introduction
**************

CLN is a library for computations with all kinds of numbers.  It has a
rich set of number classes:

   * Integers (with unlimited precision),

   * Rational numbers,

   * Floating-point numbers:

        - Short float,

        - Single float,

        - Double float,

        - Long float (with unlimited precision),

   * Complex numbers,

   * Modular integers (integers modulo a fixed integer),

   * Univariate polynomials.

The subtypes of the complex numbers among these are exactly the types
of numbers known to the Common Lisp language. Therefore `CLN' can be
used for Common Lisp implementations, giving `CLN' another meaning: it
becomes an abbreviation of "Common Lisp Numbers".

The CLN package implements

   * Elementary functions (`+', `-', `*', `/', `sqrt', comparisons,
     ...),

   * Logical functions (logical `and', `or', `not', ...),

   * Transcendental functions (exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric,
     hyperbolic functions and their inverse functions).

CLN is a C++ library. Using C++ as an implementation language provides

   * efficiency: it compiles to machine code,

   * type safety: the C++ compiler knows about the number types and
     complains if, for example, you try to assign a float to an integer
     variable.

   * algebraic syntax: You can use the `+', `-', `*', `=', `==', ...
     operators as in C or C++.

CLN is memory efficient:

   * Small integers and short floats are immediate, not heap allocated.

   * Heap-allocated memory is reclaimed through an automatic,
     non-interruptive garbage collection.

CLN is speed efficient:

   * The kernel of CLN has been written in assembly language for some
     CPUs (`i386', `m68k', `sparc', `mips', `arm').

   * On all CPUs, CLN may be configured to use the superefficient
     low-level routines from GNU GMP version 3.

   * It uses Karatsuba multiplication, which is significantly faster
     for large numbers than the standard multiplication algorithm.

   * For very large numbers (more than 12000 decimal digits), it uses
     Schoenhage-Strassen multiplication, which is an asymptotically
     optimal multiplication algorithm, for multiplication, division and
     radix conversion.

   * It uses binary splitting for fast evaluation of series of rational
     numbers as they occur in the evaluation of elementary functions
     and some constants.

CLN aims at being easily integrated into larger software packages:

   * The garbage collection imposes no burden on the main application.

   * The library provides hooks for memory allocation and throws
     exceptions in case of errors.

   * All non-macro identifiers are hidden in namespace `cln' in order
     to avoid name clashes.

This section describes how to install the CLN package on your system.

2.1 Prerequisites
=================

* Sed utility::


File: cln.info,  Node: C++ compiler,  Next: Make utility,  Up: Prerequisites

2.1.1 C++ compiler
------------------

To build CLN, you need a C++ compiler.  GNU `g++ 4.0.0' or newer is
recommended.

The following C++ features are used: classes, member functions,
overloading of functions and operators, constructors and destructors,
inline, const, multiple inheritance, templates and namespaces.

The following C++ features are not used: `new', `delete', virtual
inheritance.

CLN relies on semi-automatic ordering of initializations of static and
global variables, a feature which I could implement for GNU g++ only.
Also, it is not known whether this semi-automatic ordering works on all
platforms when a non-GNU assembler is being used.

2.1.2 Make utility
------------------

To build CLN, you also need to have GNU `make' installed.


File: cln.info,  Node: Sed utility,  Prev: Make utility,  Up: Prerequisites

2.1.3 Sed utility
-----------------

To build CLN on HP-UX, you also need to have GNU `sed' installed.  This
is because the libtool script, which creates the CLN library, relies on
`sed', and the vendor's `sed' utility on these systems is too limited.


File: cln.info,  Node: Building the library,  Next: Installing the library,  Prev: Prerequisites,  Up: Installation

2.2 Building the library
========================

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as
this:

     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make check

If on your system, `make' is not GNU `make', you have to use `gmake'
instead of `make' above.

The `configure' command checks out some features of your system and C++
compiler and builds the `Makefile's. The `make' command builds the
library. This step may take about half an hour on an average
workstation.  The `make check' runs some test to check that no
important subroutine has been miscompiled.

The `configure' command accepts options. To get a summary of them, try

     $ ./configure --help

Some of the options are explained in detail in the `INSTALL.generic'
file.

You can specify the C compiler, the C++ compiler and their options
through the following environment variables when running `configure':

`CC'
     Specifies the C compiler.

`CFLAGS'
     Flags to be given to the C compiler when compiling programs (not
     when linking).

`CXX'
     Specifies the C++ compiler.

`CXXFLAGS'
     Flags to be given to the C++ compiler when compiling programs (not
     when linking).

`CPPFLAGS'
     Flags to be given to the C/C++ preprocessor.

`LDFLAGS'
     Flags to be given to the linker.

Examples:

     $ CC="gcc" CFLAGS="-O" CXX="g++" CXXFLAGS="-O" ./configure

     $ CC="gcc -V 3.2.3" CFLAGS="-O2 -finline-limit=1000" \
       CXX="g++ -V 3.2.3" CXXFLAGS="-O2 -finline-limit=1000" \
       CPPFLAGS="-DNO_ASM" ./configure

     $ CC="gcc-4.2" CFLAGS="-O2" CXX="g++-4.2" CXXFLAGS="-O2" ./configure

Note that for these environment variables to take effect, you have to
set them (assuming a Bourne-compatible shell) on the same line as the
`configure' command. If you made the settings in earlier shell
commands, you have to `export' the environment variables before calling
`configure'. In a `csh' shell, you have to use the `setenv' command for
setting each of the environment variables.

Currently CLN works only with the GNU `g++' compiler, and only in
optimizing mode. So you should specify at least `-O' in the CXXFLAGS,
or no CXXFLAGS at all. If CXXFLAGS is not set, CLN will be compiled
with `-O'.

The assembler language kernel can be turned off by specifying
`-DNO_ASM' in the CPPFLAGS. If `make check' reports any problems, you
may try to clean up (see *note Cleaning up::) and configure and compile
again, this time with `-DNO_ASM'.

If you use `g++' 3.2.x or earlier, I recommend adding
`-finline-limit=1000' to the CXXFLAGS. This is essential for good code.

If you use `g++' from gcc-3.0.4 or older on Sparc, add either `-O',
`-O1' or `-O2 -fno-schedule-insns' to the CXXFLAGS. With full `-O2',
`g++' miscompiles the division routines. Also, do not use gcc-3.0 on
Sparc for compiling CLN, it won't work at all.

Also, please do not compile CLN with `g++' using the `-O3' optimization
level.  This leads to inferior code quality.

Some newer versions of `g++' require quite an amount of memory.  You
might need some swap space if your machine doesn't have 512 MB of RAM.

By default, both a shared and a static library are built.  You can build
CLN as a static (or shared) library only, by calling `configure' with
the option `--disable-shared' (or `--disable-static').  While shared
libraries are usually more convenient to use, they may not work on all
architectures.  Try disabling them if you run into linker problems.
Also, they are generally slightly slower than static libraries so
runtime-critical applications should be linked statically.

* Menu:

* Using the GNU MP Library::


File: cln.info,  Node: Using the GNU MP Library,  Up: Building the library

2.2.1 Using the GNU MP Library
------------------------------

CLN may be configured to make use of a preinstalled `gmp' library for
some low-level routines.  Please make sure that you have at least `gmp'
version 3.0 installed since earlier versions are unsupported and likely
not to work.  Using `gmp' is known to be quite a boost for CLN's
performance.

By default, CLN will autodetect `gmp' and use it. If you do not want
CLN to make use of a preinstalled `gmp' library, then you can
explicitly specify so by calling `configure' with the option
`--without-gmp'.

If you have installed the `gmp' library and its header files in some
place where the compiler cannot find it by default, you must help
`configure' and specify the prefix that was used when `gmp' was
configured. Here is an example:

     $ ./configure --with-gmp=/opt/gmp-4.2.2

This assumes that the `gmp' header files have been installed in
`/opt/gmp-4.2.2/include/' and the library in `/opt/gmp-4.2.2/lib/'.
More uncommon GMP installations can be handled by setting CPPFLAGS and
LDFLAGS appropriately prior to running `configure'.

2.3 Installing the library
==========================

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as
this:

     $ make install

The `make install' command installs the library and the include files
into public places (`/usr/local/lib/' and `/usr/local/include/', if you
haven't specified a `--prefix' option to `configure').  This step may
require superuser privileges.

If you have already built the library and wish to install it, but didn't
specify `--prefix=...' at configure time, just re-run `configure',
giving it the same options as the first time, plus the `--prefix=...'
option.

2.4 Cleaning up
===============

You can remove system-dependent files generated by `make' through

     $ make clean

You can remove all files generated by `make', thus reverting to a
virgin distribution of CLN, through

     $ make distclean

                      <cln/sfloat.h> <cln/ffloat.h> <cln/dfloat.h> <cln/lfloat.h>

The base class `cl_number' is an abstract base class.  It is not useful
to declare a variable of this type except if you want to completely
disable compile-time type checking and use run-time type checking
instead.

The class `cl_N' comprises real and complex numbers. There is no
special class for complex numbers since complex numbers with imaginary
part `0' are automatically converted to real numbers.

The class `cl_R' comprises real numbers of different kinds. It is an
abstract class.

The class `cl_RA' comprises exact real numbers: rational numbers,
including integers. There is no special class for non-integral rational
numbers since rational numbers with denominator `1' are automatically
converted to integers.

The class `cl_F' implements floating-point approximations to real
numbers.  It is an abstract class.

3.1 Exact numbers
=================

Some numbers are represented as exact numbers: there is no loss of
information when such a number is converted from its mathematical value
to its internal representation. On exact numbers, the elementary
operations (`+', `-', `*', `/', comparisons, ...) compute the completely
correct result.

In CLN, the exact numbers are:

   * rational numbers (including integers),

   * complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are both rational
     numbers.

Rational numbers are always normalized to the form
`NUMERATOR/DENOMINATOR' where the numerator and denominator are coprime
integers and the denominator is positive. If the resulting denominator
is `1', the rational number is converted to an integer.

Small integers (typically in the range `-2^29'...`2^29-1', for 32-bit
machines) are especially efficient, because they consume no heap
allocation. Otherwise the distinction between these immediate integers
(called "fixnums") and heap allocated integers (called "bignums") is
completely transparent.


File: cln.info,  Node: Floating-point numbers,  Next: Complex numbers,  Prev: Exact numbers,  Up: Ordinary number types

3.2 Floating-point numbers
==========================

Not all real numbers can be represented exactly. (There is an easy
mathematical proof for this: Only a countable set of numbers can be
stored exactly in a computer, even if one assumes that it has unlimited
storage. But there are uncountably many real numbers.) So some
approximation is needed.  CLN implements ordinary floating-point
numbers, with mantissa and exponent.

The elementary operations (`+', `-', `*', `/', ...)  only return
approximate results. For example, the value of the expression `(cl_F)
0.3 + (cl_F) 0.4' prints as `0.70000005', not as `0.7'. Rounding errors
like this one are inevitable when computing with floating-point numbers.

Nevertheless, CLN rounds the floating-point results of the operations
`+', `-', `*', `/', `sqrt' according to the "round-to-even" rule: It
first computes the exact mathematical result and then returns the
floating-point number which is nearest to this. If two floating-point
numbers are equally distant from the ideal result, the one with a `0'
in its least significant mantissa bit is chosen.

Similarly, testing floating point numbers for equality `x == y' is
gambling with random errors. Better check for `abs(x - y) < epsilon'
for some well-chosen `epsilon'.

Floating point numbers come in four flavors:

   * Short floats, type `cl_SF'.  They have 1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits
     (including the exponent's sign), and 17 mantissa bits (including
     the "hidden" bit).  They don't consume heap allocation.

   * Single floats, type `cl_FF'.  They have 1 sign bit, 8 exponent
     bits (including the exponent's sign), and 24 mantissa bits
     (including the "hidden" bit).  In CLN, they are represented as
     IEEE single-precision floating point numbers.  This corresponds
     closely to the C/C++ type `float'.

   * Double floats, type `cl_DF'.  They have 1 sign bit, 11 exponent
     bits (including the exponent's sign), and 53 mantissa bits
     (including the "hidden" bit).  In CLN, they are represented as
     IEEE double-precision floating point numbers.  This corresponds
     closely to the C/C++ type `double'.

   * Long floats, type `cl_LF'.  They have 1 sign bit, 32 exponent bits
     (including the exponent's sign), and n mantissa bits (including
     the "hidden" bit), where n >= 64.  The precision of a long float
     is unlimited, but once created, a long float has a fixed
     precision. (No "lazy recomputation".)

Of course, computations with long floats are more expensive than those
with smaller floating-point formats.

CLN does not implement features like NaNs, denormalized numbers and
gradual underflow. If the exponent range of some floating-point type is
too limited for your application, choose another floating-point type
with larger exponent range.

As a user of CLN, you can forget about the differences between the four
floating-point types and just declare all your floating-point variables
as being of type `cl_F'. This has the advantage that when you change
the precision of some computation (say, from `cl_DF' to `cl_LF'), you
don't have to change the code, only the precision of the initial
values. Also, many transcendental functions have been declared as
returning a `cl_F' when the argument is a `cl_F', but such declarations
are missing for the types `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF'. (Such
declarations would be wrong if the floating point contagion rule
happened to change in the future.)

3.3 Complex numbers
===================

Complex numbers, as implemented by the class `cl_N', have a real part
and an imaginary part, both real numbers. A complex number whose
imaginary part is the exact number `0' is automatically converted to a
real number.

Complex numbers can arise from real numbers alone, for example through
application of `sqrt' or transcendental functions.


File: cln.info,  Node: Conversions,  Prev: Complex numbers,  Up: Ordinary number types

3.4 Conversions
===============

Conversions from any class to any its superclasses ("base classes" in
C++ terminology) is done automatically.

Conversions from the C built-in types `long' and `unsigned long' are
provided for the classes `cl_I', `cl_RA', `cl_R', `cl_N' and
`cl_number'.

Conversions from the C built-in types `int' and `unsigned int' are
provided for the classes `cl_I', `cl_RA', `cl_R', `cl_N' and
`cl_number'. However, these conversions emphasize efficiency. On 32-bit
systems, their range is therefore limited:

   - The conversion from `int' works only if the argument is < 2^29 and
     >= -2^29.

   - The conversion from `unsigned int' works only if the argument is <
     2^29.

In a declaration like `cl_I x = 10;' the C++ compiler is able to do the
conversion of `10' from `int' to `cl_I' at compile time already. On the
other hand, code like `cl_I x = 1000000000;' is in error on 32-bit
machines.  So, if you want to be sure that an `int' whose magnitude is
not guaranteed to be < 2^29 is correctly converted to a `cl_I', first
convert it to a `long'. Similarly, if a large `unsigned int' is to be
converted to a `cl_I', first convert it to an `unsigned long'. On
64-bit machines there is no such restriction. There, conversions from
arbitrary 32-bit `int' values always works correctly.

Conversions from the C built-in type `float' are provided for the
classes `cl_FF', `cl_F', `cl_R', `cl_N' and `cl_number'.

Conversions from the C built-in type `double' are provided for the
classes `cl_DF', `cl_F', `cl_R', `cl_N' and `cl_number'.

Conversions from `const char *' are provided for the classes `cl_I',
`cl_RA', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF', `cl_F', `cl_R', `cl_N'.
The easiest way to specify a value which is outside of the range of the
C++ built-in types is therefore to specify it as a string, like this: 
        cl_I order_of_rubiks_cube_group = "43252003274489856000";
Note that this conversion is done at runtime, not at compile-time.

Conversions from `cl_I' to the C built-in types `int', `unsigned int',
`long', `unsigned long' are provided through the functions

`int cl_I_to_int (const cl_I& x)'
`unsigned int cl_I_to_uint (const cl_I& x)'
`long cl_I_to_long (const cl_I& x)'
`unsigned long cl_I_to_ulong (const cl_I& x)'
     Returns `x' as element of the C type CTYPE. If `x' is not
     representable in the range of CTYPE, a runtime error occurs.

Conversions from the classes `cl_I', `cl_RA', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF', `cl_F' and `cl_R' to the C built-in types `float' and
`double' are provided through the functions

`float float_approx (const TYPE& x)'
`double double_approx (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns an approximation of `x' of C type CTYPE.  If `abs(x)' is
     too close to 0 (underflow), 0 is returned.  If `abs(x)' is too
     large (overflow), an IEEE infinity is returned.

Conversions from any class to any of its subclasses ("derived classes"
in C++ terminology) are not provided. Instead, you can assert and check
that a value belongs to a certain subclass, and return it as element of
that class, using the `As' and `The' macros.  `As(TYPE)(VALUE)' checks
that VALUE belongs to TYPE and returns it as such.  `The(TYPE)(VALUE)'
assumes that VALUE belongs to TYPE and returns it as such. It is your
responsibility to ensure that this assumption is valid.  Since macros
and namespaces don't go together well, there is an equivalent to `The':
the template `the'.

Example:

        cl_I x = ...;
        if (!(x >= 0)) abort();
        cl_I ten_x_a = The(cl_I)(expt(10,x)); // If x >= 0, 10^x is an integer.
                     // In general, it would be a rational number.
        cl_I ten_x_b = the<cl_I>(expt(10,x)); // The same as above.

4.1.1 Constructing integers
---------------------------

`cl_I' objects are most easily constructed from C integers and from
strings. See *note Conversions::.

4.1.2 Constructing rational numbers
-----------------------------------

`cl_RA' objects can be constructed from strings. The syntax for
rational numbers is described in *note Internal and printed
representation::.  Another standard way to produce a rational number is
through application of `operator /' or `recip' on integers.

4.1.3 Constructing floating-point numbers
-----------------------------------------

`cl_F' objects with low precision are most easily constructed from C
`float' and `double'. See *note Conversions::.

To construct a `cl_F' with high precision, you can use the conversion
from `const char *', but you have to specify the desired precision
within the string. (See *note Internal and printed representation::.)
Example:
        cl_F e = "0.271828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369996e+1_40";
will set `e' to the given value, with a precision of 40 decimal digits.

The programmatic way to construct a `cl_F' with high precision is
through the `cl_float' conversion function, see *note Conversion to
floating-point numbers::. For example, to compute `e' to 40 decimal
places, first construct 1.0 to 40 decimal places and then apply the
exponential function:
        float_format_t precision = float_format(40);
        cl_F e = exp(cl_float(1,precision));

4.2 Elementary functions
========================

Each of the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF',
`cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`TYPE operator + (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
     Addition.

`TYPE operator - (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
     Subtraction.

`TYPE operator - (const TYPE&)'
     Returns the negative of the argument.

`TYPE plus1 (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `x + 1'.

`TYPE minus1 (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `x - 1'.

`TYPE operator * (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
     Multiplication.

`TYPE square (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `x * x'.

Each of the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`TYPE operator / (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
     Division.

`TYPE recip (const TYPE&)'
     Returns the reciprocal of the argument.

The class `cl_I' doesn't define a `/' operation because in the C/C++
language this operator, applied to integral types, denotes the `floor'
or `truncate' operation (which one of these, is implementation
dependent). (*Note Rounding functions::.)  Instead, `cl_I' defines an
"exact quotient" function:

`cl_I exquo (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Checks that `y' divides `x', and returns the quotient `x'/`y'.

The following exponentiation functions are defined:

`cl_I expt_pos (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
`cl_RA expt_pos (const cl_RA& x, const cl_I& y)'
     `y' must be > 0. Returns `x^y'.

`cl_RA expt (const cl_RA& x, const cl_I& y)'
`cl_R expt (const cl_R& x, const cl_I& y)'
`cl_N expt (const cl_N& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Returns `x^y'.

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operation:

`TYPE abs (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the absolute value of `x'.  This is `x' if `x >= 0', and
     `-x' if `x <= 0'.

The class `cl_N' implements this as follows:

`cl_R abs (const cl_N x)'
     Returns the absolute value of `x'.

Each of the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF',
`cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operation:

`TYPE signum (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the sign of `x', in the same number format as `x'.  This
     is defined as `x / abs(x)' if `x' is non-zero, and `x' if `x' is
     zero. If `x' is real, the value is either 0 or 1 or -1.

4.3 Elementary rational functions
=================================

Each of the classes `cl_RA', `cl_I' defines the following operations:

`cl_I numerator (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the numerator of `x'.

`cl_I denominator (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the denominator of `x'.

The numerator and denominator of a rational number are normalized in
such a way that they have no factor in common and the denominator is
positive.


File: cln.info,  Node: Elementary complex functions,  Next: Comparisons,  Prev: Elementary rational functions,  Up: Functions on numbers

4.4 Elementary complex functions
================================

The class `cl_N' defines the following operation:

`cl_N complex (const cl_R& a, const cl_R& b)'
     Returns the complex number `a+bi', that is, the complex number with
     real part `a' and imaginary part `b'.

Each of the classes `cl_N', `cl_R' defines the following operations:

`cl_R realpart (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the real part of `x'.

`cl_R imagpart (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the imaginary part of `x'.

`TYPE conjugate (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the complex conjugate of `x'.

We have the relations

     `x = complex(realpart(x), imagpart(x))'

     `conjugate(x) = complex(realpart(x), -imagpart(x))'


File: cln.info,  Node: Comparisons,  Next: Rounding functions,  Prev: Elementary complex functions,  Up: Functions on numbers

4.5 Comparisons
===============

Each of the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF',
`cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`bool operator == (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`bool operator != (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
     Comparison, as in C and C++.

`uint32 equal_hashcode (const TYPE&)'
     Returns a 32-bit hash code that is the same for any two numbers
     which are the same according to `=='. This hash code depends on
     the number's value, not its type or precision.

`bool zerop (const TYPE& x)'
     Compare against zero: `x == 0'

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`cl_signean compare (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Compares `x' and `y'. Returns +1 if `x'>`y', -1 if `x'<`y', 0 if
     `x'=`y'.

`bool operator <= (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`bool operator < (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`bool operator >= (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`bool operator > (const TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
     Comparison, as in C and C++.

`bool minusp (const TYPE& x)'
     Compare against zero: `x < 0'

`bool plusp (const TYPE& x)'
     Compare against zero: `x > 0'

`TYPE max (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Return the maximum of `x' and `y'.

`TYPE min (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Return the minimum of `x' and `y'.

When a floating point number and a rational number are compared, the
float is first converted to a rational number using the function
`rational'.  Since a floating point number actually represents an
interval of real numbers, the result might be surprising.  For example,
`(cl_F)(cl_R)"1/3" == (cl_R)"1/3"' returns false because there is no
floating point number whose value is exactly `1/3'.


File: cln.info,  Node: Rounding functions,  Next: Roots,  Prev: Comparisons,  Up: Functions on numbers

4.6 Rounding functions
======================

When a real number is to be converted to an integer, there is no "best"
rounding. The desired rounding function depends on the application.
The Common Lisp and ISO Lisp standards offer four rounding functions:

`floor(x)'
     This is the largest integer <=`x'.

`ceiling(x)'
     This is the smallest integer >=`x'.

`truncate(x)'
     Among the integers between 0 and `x' (inclusive) the one nearest
     to `x'.

`round(x)'
     The integer nearest to `x'. If `x' is exactly halfway between two
     integers, choose the even one.

These functions have different advantages:

`floor' and `ceiling' are translation invariant: `floor(x+n) = floor(x)
+ n' and `ceiling(x+n) = ceiling(x) + n' for every `x' and every
integer `n'.

On the other hand, `truncate' and `round' are symmetric: `truncate(-x)
= -truncate(x)' and `round(-x) = -round(x)', and furthermore `round' is
unbiased: on the "average", it rounds down exactly as often as it
rounds up.

The functions are related like this:

     `ceiling(m/n) = floor((m+n-1)/n) = floor((m-1)/n)+1' for rational
     numbers `m/n' (`m', `n' integers, `n'>0), and

     `truncate(x) = sign(x) * floor(abs(x))'

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF',
`cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`cl_I floor1 (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `floor(x)'.

`cl_I ceiling1 (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `ceiling(x)'.

`cl_I truncate1 (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `truncate(x)'.

`cl_I round1 (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns `round(x)'.

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`cl_I floor1 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Returns `floor(x/y)'.

`cl_I ceiling1 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Returns `ceiling(x/y)'.

`cl_I truncate1 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Returns `truncate(x/y)'.

`cl_I round1 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
     Returns `round(x/y)'.

These functions are called `floor1', ... here instead of `floor', ...,
because on some systems, system dependent include files define `floor'
and `ceiling' as macros.

In many cases, one needs both the quotient and the remainder of a
division.  It is more efficient to compute both at the same time than
to perform two divisions, one for quotient and the next one for the
remainder.  The following functions therefore return a structure
containing both the quotient and the remainder. The suffix `2'
indicates the number of "return values". The remainder is defined as
follows:

   * for the computation of `quotient = floor(x)', `remainder = x -
     quotient',

   * for the computation of `quotient = floor(x,y)', `remainder = x -
     quotient*y',

and similarly for the other three operations.

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF',
`cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`struct TYPE_div_t { cl_I quotient; TYPE remainder; };'
`TYPE_div_t floor2 (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE_div_t ceiling2 (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE_div_t truncate2 (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE_div_t round2 (const TYPE& x)'

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines the following operations:

`struct TYPE_div_t { cl_I quotient; TYPE remainder; };'
`TYPE_div_t floor2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE_div_t ceiling2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE_div_t truncate2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE_div_t round2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'

Sometimes, one wants the quotient as a floating-point number (of the
same format as the argument, if the argument is a float) instead of as
an integer. The prefix `f' indicates this.

Each of the classes `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines
the following operations:

`TYPE ffloor (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE fceiling (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE ftruncate (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE fround (const TYPE& x)'

and similarly for class `cl_R', but with return type `cl_F'.

The class `cl_R' defines the following operations:

`cl_F ffloor (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`cl_F fceiling (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`cl_F ftruncate (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`cl_F fround (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'

These functions also exist in versions which return both the quotient
and the remainder. The suffix `2' indicates this.

Each of the classes `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines
the following operations: 

`struct TYPE_fdiv_t { TYPE quotient; TYPE remainder; };'
`TYPE_fdiv_t ffloor2 (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE_fdiv_t fceiling2 (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE_fdiv_t ftruncate2 (const TYPE& x)'
`TYPE_fdiv_t fround2 (const TYPE& x)'
and similarly for class `cl_R', but with quotient type `cl_F'.  

The class `cl_R' defines the following operations:

`struct TYPE_fdiv_t { cl_F quotient; cl_R remainder; };'
`TYPE_fdiv_t ffloor2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE_fdiv_t fceiling2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE_fdiv_t ftruncate2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE_fdiv_t fround2 (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'

Other applications need only the remainder of a division.  The
remainder of `floor' and `ffloor' is called `mod' (abbreviation of
"modulo"). The remainder `truncate' and `ftruncate' is called `rem'
(abbreviation of "remainder").

   * `mod(x,y) = floor2(x,y).remainder = x - floor(x/y)*y'

   * `rem(x,y) = truncate2(x,y).remainder = x - truncate(x/y)*y'

If `x' and `y' are both >= 0, `mod(x,y) = rem(x,y) >= 0'.  In general,
`mod(x,y)' has the sign of `y' or is zero, and `rem(x,y)' has the sign
of `x' or is zero.

The classes `cl_R', `cl_I' define the following operations:

`TYPE mod (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'
`TYPE rem (const TYPE& x, const TYPE& y)'

4.7 Roots
=========

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF'
defines the following operation:

`TYPE sqrt (const TYPE& x)'
     `x' must be >= 0. This function returns the square root of `x',
     normalized to be >= 0. If `x' is the square of a rational number,
     `sqrt(x)' will be a rational number, else it will return a
     floating-point approximation.

The classes `cl_RA', `cl_I' define the following operation:

`bool sqrtp (const TYPE& x, TYPE* root)'
     This tests whether `x' is a perfect square. If so, it returns true
     and the exact square root in `*root', else it returns false.

Furthermore, for integers, similarly:

`bool isqrt (const TYPE& x, TYPE* root)'
     `x' should be >= 0. This function sets `*root' to `floor(sqrt(x))'
     and returns the same value as `sqrtp': the boolean value
     `(expt(*root,2) == x)'.

For `n'th roots, the classes `cl_RA', `cl_I' define the following
operation:

`bool rootp (const TYPE& x, const cl_I& n, TYPE* root)'
     `x' must be >= 0. `n' must be > 0.  This tests whether `x' is an
     `n'th power of a rational number.  If so, it returns true and the
     exact root in `*root', else it returns false.

The only square root function which accepts negative numbers is the one
for class `cl_N':

`cl_N sqrt (const cl_N& z)'
     Returns the square root of `z', as defined by the formula `sqrt(z)
     = exp(log(z)/2)'. Conversion to a floating-point type or to a
     complex number are done if necessary. The range of the result is
     the right half plane `realpart(sqrt(z)) >= 0' including the
     positive imaginary axis and 0, but excluding the negative
     imaginary axis.  The result is an exact number only if `z' is an
     exact number.

4.8 Transcendental functions
============================

The transcendental functions return an exact result if the argument is
exact and the result is exact as well. Otherwise they must return
inexact numbers even if the argument is exact.  For example, `cos(0) =
1' returns the rational number `1'.

4.8.1 Exponential and logarithmic functions
-------------------------------------------

`cl_R exp (const cl_R& x)'
`cl_N exp (const cl_N& x)'
     Returns the exponential function of `x'. This is `e^x' where `e'
     is the base of the natural logarithms. The range of the result is
     the entire complex plane excluding 0.

`cl_R ln (const cl_R& x)'
     `x' must be > 0. Returns the (natural) logarithm of x.

`cl_N log (const cl_N& x)'
     Returns the (natural) logarithm of x. If `x' is real and positive,
     this is `ln(x)'. In general, `log(x) = log(abs(x)) + i*phase(x)'.
     The range of the result is the strip in the complex plane `-pi <
     imagpart(log(x)) <= pi'.

`cl_R phase (const cl_N& x)'
     Returns the angle part of `x' in its polar representation as a
     complex number. That is, `phase(x) =
     atan(realpart(x),imagpart(x))'.  This is also the imaginary part
     of `log(x)'.  The range of the result is the interval `-pi <
     phase(x) <= pi'.  The result will be an exact number only if
     `zerop(x)' or if `x' is real and positive.

`cl_R log (const cl_R& a, const cl_R& b)'
     `a' and `b' must be > 0. Returns the logarithm of `a' with respect
     to base `b'. `log(a,b) = ln(a)/ln(b)'.  The result can be exact
     only if `a = 1' or if `a' and `b' are both rational.

`cl_N log (const cl_N& a, const cl_N& b)'
     Returns the logarithm of `a' with respect to base `b'.  `log(a,b)
     = log(a)/log(b)'.

`cl_N expt (const cl_N& x, const cl_N& y)'
     Exponentiation: Returns `x^y = exp(y*log(x))'.

The constant e = exp(1) = 2.71828... is returned by the following
functions:

`cl_F exp1 (float_format_t f)'
     Returns e as a float of format `f'.

`cl_F exp1 (const cl_F& y)'
     Returns e in the float format of `y'.

`cl_F exp1 (void)'
     Returns e as a float of format `default_float_format'.

4.8.2 Trigonometric functions
-----------------------------

`cl_R sin (const cl_R& x)'
     Returns `sin(x)'. The range of the result is the interval `-1 <=
     sin(x) <= 1'.

`cl_N sin (const cl_N& z)'
     Returns `sin(z)'. The range of the result is the entire complex
     plane.

`cl_R cos (const cl_R& x)'
     Returns `cos(x)'. The range of the result is the interval `-1 <=
     cos(x) <= 1'.

`cl_N cos (const cl_N& x)'
     Returns `cos(z)'. The range of the result is the entire complex
     plane.

`struct cos_sin_t { cl_R cos; cl_R sin; };'
`cos_sin_t cos_sin (const cl_R& x)'
     Returns both `sin(x)' and `cos(x)'. This is more efficient than computing
     them separately. The relation `cos^2 + sin^2 = 1' will hold only
     approximately.

`cl_R tan (const cl_R& x)'
`cl_N tan (const cl_N& x)'
     Returns `tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)'.

`cl_N cis (const cl_R& x)'
`cl_N cis (const cl_N& x)'
     Returns `exp(i*x)'. The name `cis' means "cos + i sin", because
     `e^(i*x) = cos(x) + i*sin(x)'.

`cl_N asin (const cl_N& z)'
     Returns `arcsin(z)'. This is defined as `arcsin(z) =
     log(iz+sqrt(1-z^2))/i' and satisfies `arcsin(-z) = -arcsin(z)'.
     The range of the result is the strip in the complex domain `-pi/2
     <= realpart(arcsin(z)) <= pi/2', excluding the numbers with
     `realpart = -pi/2' and `imagpart < 0' and the numbers with
     `realpart = pi/2' and `imagpart > 0'.

`cl_N acos (const cl_N& z)'
     Returns `arccos(z)'. This is defined as `arccos(z) = pi/2 -
     arcsin(z) = log(z+i*sqrt(1-z^2))/i' and satisfies `arccos(-z) = pi
     - arccos(z)'.  The range of the result is the strip in the complex
     domain `0 <= realpart(arcsin(z)) <= pi', excluding the numbers
     with `realpart = 0' and `imagpart < 0' and the numbers with
     `realpart = pi' and `imagpart > 0'.

`cl_R atan (const cl_R& x, const cl_R& y)'
     Returns the angle of the polar representation of the complex number
     `x+iy'. This is `atan(y/x)' if `x>0'. The range of the result is
     the interval `-pi < atan(x,y) <= pi'. The result will be an exact
     number only if `x > 0' and `y' is the exact `0'.  WARNING: In
     Common Lisp, this function is called as `(atan y x)', with
     reversed order of arguments.

`cl_R atan (const cl_R& x)'
     Returns `arctan(x)'. This is the same as `atan(1,x)'. The range of
     the result is the interval `-pi/2 < atan(x) < pi/2'. The result
     will be an exact number only if `x' is the exact `0'.

     domain `-pi/2 <= realpart(arctan(z)) <= pi/2', excluding the
     numbers with `realpart = -pi/2' and `imagpart >= 0' and the numbers
     with `realpart = pi/2' and `imagpart <= 0'.

     and `realpart < 0'.

`cl_N acosh (const cl_N& z)'
     Returns `arcosh(z)'. This is defined as `arcosh(z) =

     the half-strip in the complex domain `-pi < imagpart(arcosh(z)) <=

     <= imagpart(artanh(z)) <= pi/2', excluding the numbers with
     `imagpart = -pi/2' and `realpart <= 0' and the numbers with
     `imagpart = pi/2' and `realpart >= 0'.

File: cln.info,  Node: Logical functions,  Next: Number theoretic functions,  Up: Functions on integers

4.9.1 Logical functions
-----------------------

Integers, when viewed as in two's complement notation, can be thought as
infinite bit strings where the bits' values eventually are constant.
For example,
         17 = ......00010001
         -6 = ......11111010

The logical operations view integers as such bit strings and operate on
each of the bit positions in parallel.

`cl_I lognot (const cl_I& x)'
`cl_I operator ~ (const cl_I& x)'
     Logical not, like `~x' in C. This is the same as `-1-x'.

`cl_I logand (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
`cl_I operator & (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Logical and, like `x & y' in C.

`cl_I logior (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
`cl_I operator | (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Logical (inclusive) or, like `x | y' in C.

`cl_I logxor (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
`cl_I operator ^ (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Exclusive or, like `x ^ y' in C.

`cl_I logeqv (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Bitwise equivalence, like `~(x ^ y)' in C.

`cl_I lognand (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Bitwise not and, like `~(x & y)' in C.

`cl_I lognor (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Bitwise not or, like `~(x | y)' in C.

`cl_I logandc1 (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Logical and, complementing the first argument, like `~x & y' in C.

`cl_I logandc2 (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Logical and, complementing the second argument, like `x & ~y' in C.

`cl_I logorc1 (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Logical or, complementing the first argument, like `~x | y' in C.

`cl_I logorc2 (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Logical or, complementing the second argument, like `x | ~y' in C.

These operations are all available though the function
`cl_I boole (cl_boole op, const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
where `op' must have one of the 16 values (each one stands for a
function which combines two bits into one bit): `boole_clr',
`boole_set', `boole_1', `boole_2', `boole_c1', `boole_c2', `boole_and',
`boole_ior', `boole_xor', `boole_eqv', `boole_nand', `boole_nor',
`boole_andc1', `boole_andc2', `boole_orc1', `boole_orc2'.  

Other functions that view integers as bit strings:

`bool logtest (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Returns true if some bit is set in both `x' and `y', i.e. if
     `logand(x,y) != 0'.

`bool logbitp (const cl_I& n, const cl_I& x)'
     Returns true if the `n'th bit (from the right) of `x' is set.  Bit
     0 is the least significant bit.

`uintC logcount (const cl_I& x)'
     Returns the number of one bits in `x', if `x' >= 0, or the number
     of zero bits in `x', if `x' < 0.

The following functions operate on intervals of bits in integers.  The
type
     struct cl_byte { uintC size; uintC position; };
represents the bit interval containing the bits
`position'...`position+size-1' of an integer.  The constructor
`cl_byte(size,position)' constructs a `cl_byte'.

`cl_I ldb (const cl_I& n, const cl_byte& b)'
     extracts the bits of `n' described by the bit interval `b' and
     returns them as a nonnegative integer with `b.size' bits.

`bool ldb_test (const cl_I& n, const cl_byte& b)'
     Returns true if some bit described by the bit interval `b' is set
     in `n'.

`cl_I dpb (const cl_I& newbyte, const cl_I& n, const cl_byte& b)'
     Returns `n', with the bits described by the bit interval `b'
     replaced by `newbyte'. Only the lowest `b.size' bits of `newbyte'
     are relevant.

The functions `ldb' and `dpb' implicitly shift. The following functions
are their counterparts without shifting:

`cl_I mask_field (const cl_I& n, const cl_byte& b)'
     returns an integer with the bits described by the bit interval `b'
     copied from the corresponding bits in `n', the other bits zero.

`cl_I deposit_field (const cl_I& newbyte, const cl_I& n, const cl_byte& b)'
     returns an integer where the bits described by the bit interval `b'
     come from `newbyte' and the other bits come from `n'.

The following relations hold:

     `ldb (n, b) = mask_field(n, b) >> b.position',

     `dpb (newbyte, n, b) = deposit_field (newbyte << b.position, n,
     b)',

     `deposit_field(newbyte,n,b) = n ^ mask_field(n,b) ^
     mask_field(new_byte,b)'.

The following operations on integers as bit strings are efficient
shortcuts for common arithmetic operations:

`bool oddp (const cl_I& x)'
     Returns true if the least significant bit of `x' is 1. Equivalent
     to `mod(x,2) != 0'.

`bool evenp (const cl_I& x)'
     Returns true if the least significant bit of `x' is 0. Equivalent
     to `mod(x,2) == 0'.

`cl_I operator << (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& n)'
     Shifts `x' by `n' bits to the left. `n' should be >=0.  Equivalent
     to `x * expt(2,n)'.

`cl_I operator >> (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& n)'
     Shifts `x' by `n' bits to the right. `n' should be >=0.  Bits
     shifted out to the right are thrown away.  Equivalent to `floor(x
     / expt(2,n))'.

`cl_I ash (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Shifts `x' by `y' bits to the left (if `y'>=0) or by `-y' bits to
     the right (if `y'<=0). In other words, this returns `floor(x *
     expt(2,y))'.

`uintC integer_length (const cl_I& x)'
     Returns the number of bits (excluding the sign bit) needed to
     represent `x' in two's complement notation. This is the smallest n
     >= 0 such that -2^n <= x < 2^n. If x > 0, this is the unique n > 0
     such that 2^(n-1) <= x < 2^n.

`uintC ord2 (const cl_I& x)'
     `x' must be non-zero. This function returns the number of 0 bits
     at the right of `x' in two's complement notation. This is the
     largest n >= 0 such that 2^n divides `x'.

`uintC power2p (const cl_I& x)'
     `x' must be > 0. This function checks whether `x' is a power of 2.
     If `x' = 2^(n-1), it returns n. Else it returns 0.  (See also the
     function `logp'.)

4.9.2 Number theoretic functions
--------------------------------

`uint32 gcd (unsigned long a, unsigned long b)'
`cl_I gcd (const cl_I& a, const cl_I& b)'
     This function returns the greatest common divisor of `a' and `b',
     normalized to be >= 0.

`cl_I xgcd (const cl_I& a, const cl_I& b, cl_I* u, cl_I* v)'
     This function ("extended gcd") returns the greatest common divisor
     `g' of `a' and `b' and at the same time the representation of `g'
     as an integral linear combination of `a' and `b': `u' and `v' with
     `u*a+v*b = g', `g' >= 0.  `u' and `v' will be normalized to be of
     smallest possible absolute value, in the following sense: If `a'
     and `b' are non-zero, and `abs(a) != abs(b)', `u' and `v' will
     satisfy the inequalities `abs(u) <= abs(b)/(2*g)', `abs(v) <=
     abs(a)/(2*g)'.

`cl_I lcm (const cl_I& a, const cl_I& b)'
     This function returns the least common multiple of `a' and `b',
     normalized to be >= 0.

`bool logp (const cl_I& a, const cl_I& b, cl_RA* l)'
`bool logp (const cl_RA& a, const cl_RA& b, cl_RA* l)'
     `a' must be > 0. `b' must be >0 and != 1. If log(a,b) is rational
     number, this function returns true and sets *l = log(a,b), else it
     returns false.

`int jacobi (signed long a, signed long b)'
`int jacobi (const cl_I& a, const cl_I& b)'
     Returns the Jacobi symbol (a/b), `a,b' must be integers, `b>0' and
     odd. The result is 0 iff gcd(a,b)>1.

`bool isprobprime (const cl_I& n)'
     Returns true if `n' is a small prime or passes the Miller-Rabin
     primality test. The probability of a false positive is 1:10^30.

`cl_I nextprobprime (const cl_R& x)'
     Returns the smallest probable prime >=`x'.

4.9.3 Combinatorial functions
-----------------------------

`cl_I factorial (uintL n)'
     `n' must be a small integer >= 0. This function returns the
     factorial `n'! = `1*2*...*n'.

`cl_I doublefactorial (uintL n)'
     `n' must be a small integer >= 0. This function returns the
     doublefactorial `n'!! = `1*3*...*n' or `n'!! = `2*4*...*n',
     respectively.

`cl_I binomial (uintL n, uintL k)'
     `n' and `k' must be small integers >= 0. This function returns the
     binomial coefficient (`n' choose `k') = `n'! / `k'! `(n-k)'!  for
     0 <= k <= n, 0 else.

4.10 Functions on floating-point numbers
========================================

Recall that a floating-point number consists of a sign `s', an exponent
`e' and a mantissa `m'. The value of the number is `(-1)^s * 2^e * m'.

Each of the classes `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines
the following operations.

`TYPE scale_float (const TYPE& x, sintC delta)'
`TYPE scale_float (const TYPE& x, const cl_I& delta)'
     Returns `x*2^delta'. This is more efficient than an explicit
     multiplication because it copies `x' and modifies the exponent.

The following functions provide an abstract interface to the underlying
representation of floating-point numbers.

`sintE float_exponent (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the exponent `e' of `x'.  For `x = 0.0', this is 0. For
     `x' non-zero, this is the unique integer with `2^(e-1) <= abs(x) <
     2^e'.

`sintL float_radix (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the base of the floating-point representation. This is
     always `2'.

`TYPE float_sign (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the sign `s' of `x' as a float. The value is 1 for `x' >=
     0, -1 for `x' < 0.

`uintC float_digits (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the number of mantissa bits in the floating-point
     representation of `x', including the hidden bit. The value only
     depends on the type of `x', not on its value.

`uintC float_precision (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the number of significant mantissa bits in the
     floating-point representation of `x'. Since denormalized numbers
     are not supported, this is the same as `float_digits(x)' if `x' is
     non-zero, and 0 if `x' = 0.

The complete internal representation of a float is encoded in the type `decoded_float'
(or `decoded_sfloat', `decoded_ffloat', `decoded_dfloat',
`decoded_lfloat', respectively), defined by
     struct decoded_TYPEfloat {
             TYPE mantissa; cl_I exponent; TYPE sign;
     };

and returned by the function

`decoded_TYPEfloat decode_float (const TYPE& x)'
     For `x' non-zero, this returns `(-1)^s', `e', `m' with `x = (-1)^s
     * 2^e * m' and `0.5 <= m < 1.0'. For `x' = 0, it returns
     `(-1)^s'=1, `e'=0, `m'=0.  `e' is the same as returned by the
     function `float_exponent'.

A complete decoding in terms of integers is provided as type 
     struct cl_idecoded_float {
             cl_I mantissa; cl_I exponent; cl_I sign;
     };
by the following function:

`cl_idecoded_float integer_decode_float (const TYPE& x)'
     For `x' non-zero, this returns `(-1)^s', `e', `m' with `x = (-1)^s
     * 2^e * m' and `m' an integer with `float_digits(x)' bits. For `x'
     = 0, it returns `(-1)^s'=1, `e'=0, `m'=0.  WARNING: The exponent
     `e' is not the same as the one returned by the functions
     `decode_float' and `float_exponent'.

Some other function, implemented only for class `cl_F':

`cl_F float_sign (const cl_F& x, const cl_F& y)'
     This returns a floating point number whose precision and absolute
     value is that of `y' and whose sign is that of `x'. If `x' is
     zero, it is treated as positive. Same for `y'.

4.11.1 Conversion to floating-point numbers
-------------------------------------------

The type `float_format_t' describes a floating-point format.  

`float_format_t float_format (uintE n)'
     Returns the smallest float format which guarantees at least `n'
     decimal digits in the mantissa (after the decimal point).

`float_format_t float_format (const cl_F& x)'
     Returns the floating point format of `x'.

`float_format_t default_float_format'
     Global variable: the default float format used when converting
     rational numbers to floats.

To convert a real number to a float, each of the types `cl_R', `cl_F',
`cl_I', `cl_RA', `int', `unsigned int', `float', `double' defines the
following operations:

`cl_F cl_float (const TYPE&x, float_format_t f)'
     Returns `x' as a float of format `f'.

`cl_F cl_float (const TYPE&x, const cl_F& y)'
     Returns `x' in the float format of `y'.

`cl_F cl_float (const TYPE&x)'
     Returns `x' as a float of format `default_float_format' if it is
     an exact number, or `x' itself if it is already a float.

Of course, converting a number to a float can lose precision.

Every floating-point format has some characteristic numbers:

`cl_F most_positive_float (float_format_t f)'
     Returns the largest (most positive) floating point number in float
     format `f'.

`cl_F most_negative_float (float_format_t f)'
     Returns the smallest (most negative) floating point number in
     float format `f'.

`cl_F least_positive_float (float_format_t f)'
     Returns the least positive floating point number (i.e. > 0 but
     closest to 0) in float format `f'.

`cl_F least_negative_float (float_format_t f)'
     Returns the least negative floating point number (i.e. < 0 but
     closest to 0) in float format `f'.

`cl_F float_epsilon (float_format_t f)'
     Returns the smallest floating point number e > 0 such that `1+e !=
     1'.

`cl_F float_negative_epsilon (float_format_t f)'
     Returns the smallest floating point number e > 0 such that `1-e !=
     1'.

4.11.2 Conversion to rational numbers
-------------------------------------

Each of the classes `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_F' defines the following
operation:

`cl_RA rational (const TYPE& x)'
     Returns the value of `x' as an exact number. If `x' is already an
     exact number, this is `x'. If `x' is a floating-point number, the
     value is a rational number whose denominator is a power of 2.

In order to convert back, say, `(cl_F)(cl_R)"1/3"' to `1/3', there is
the function

`cl_RA rationalize (const cl_R& x)'
     If `x' is a floating-point number, it actually represents an
     interval of real numbers, and this function returns the rational
     number with smallest denominator (and smallest numerator, in
     magnitude) which lies in this interval.  If `x' is already an
     exact number, this function returns `x'.

If `x' is any float, one has

     `cl_float(rational(x),x) = x'

     `cl_float(rationalize(x),x) = x'

4.12 Random number generators
=============================

A random generator is a machine which produces (pseudo-)random numbers.
The include file `<cln/random.h>' defines a class `random_state' which
contains the state of a random generator. If you make a copy of the
random number generator, the original one and the copy will produce the
same sequence of random numbers.

The following functions return (pseudo-)random numbers in different
formats.  Calling one of these modifies the state of the random number
generator in a complicated but deterministic way.

The global variable 
     random_state default_random_state
contains a default random number generator. It is used when the
functions below are called without `random_state' argument.

`uint32 random32 (random_state& randomstate)'
`uint32 random32 ()'
     Returns a random unsigned 32-bit number. All bits are equally
     random.

`cl_I random_I (random_state& randomstate, const cl_I& n)'
`cl_I random_I (const cl_I& n)'
     `n' must be an integer > 0. This function returns a random integer
     `x' in the range `0 <= x < n'.

`cl_F random_F (random_state& randomstate, const cl_F& n)'
`cl_F random_F (const cl_F& n)'
     `n' must be a float > 0. This function returns a random
     floating-point number of the same format as `n' in the range `0 <=
     x < n'.

`cl_R random_R (random_state& randomstate, const cl_R& n)'
`cl_R random_R (const cl_R& n)'
     Behaves like `random_I' if `n' is an integer and like `random_F'
     if `n' is a float.

The modifying C/C++ operators `+=', `-=', `*=', `/=', `&=', `|=', `^=',
`<<=', `>>=' are all available.

For the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_F', `cl_SF', `cl_FF',
`cl_DF', `cl_LF':

`TYPE& operator += (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator -= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator *= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator /= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'

For the class `cl_I':

`TYPE& operator += (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator -= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator *= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator &= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator |= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator ^= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator <<= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'
`TYPE& operator >>= (TYPE&, const TYPE&)'

For the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF',
`cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF':

`TYPE& operator ++ (TYPE& x)'
     The prefix operator `++x'.

`void operator ++ (TYPE& x, int)'
     The postfix operator `x++'.

`TYPE& operator -- (TYPE& x)'
     The prefix operator `--x'.

`void operator -- (TYPE& x, int)'
     The postfix operator `x--'.

Note that by using these modifying operators, you don't gain efficiency:
In CLN `x += y;' is exactly the same as  `x = x+y;', not more efficient.

File: cln.info,  Node: Internal and printed representation,  Next: Input functions,  Up: Input/Output

5.1 Internal and printed representation
=======================================

All computations deal with the internal representations of the numbers.

Every number has an external representation as a sequence of ASCII
characters.  Several external representations may denote the same
number, for example, "20.0" and "20.000".

Converting an internal to an external representation is called
"printing", converting an external to an internal representation is
called "reading".  In CLN, it is always true that conversion of an
internal to an external representation and then back to an internal
representation will yield the same internal representation.
Symbolically: `read(print(x)) == x'.  This is called "print-read
consistency".

Different types of numbers have different external representations (case
is insignificant):

Integers
     External representation: SIGN{DIGIT}+. The reader also accepts the
     Common Lisp syntaxes SIGN{DIGIT}+`.' with a trailing dot for
     decimal integers and the `#NR', `#b', `#o', `#x' prefixes.

Rational numbers
     External representation: SIGN{DIGIT}+`/'{DIGIT}+.  The `#NR',
     `#b', `#o', `#x' prefixes are allowed here as well.

Floating-point numbers
     External representation: SIGN{DIGIT}*EXPONENT or
     SIGN{DIGIT}*`.'{DIGIT}*EXPONENT or SIGN{DIGIT}*`.'{DIGIT}+. A
     precision specifier of the form _PREC may be appended. There must
     be at least one digit in the non-exponent part. The exponent has
     the syntax EXPMARKER EXPSIGN {DIGIT}+.  The exponent marker is

          `s' for short-floats,

          `f' for single-floats,

          `d' for double-floats,

          `L' for long-floats,

     or `e', which denotes a default float format. The precision
     specifying suffix has the syntax _PREC where PREC denotes the
     number of valid mantissa digits (in decimal, excluding leading
     zeroes), cf. also function `float_format'.

Complex numbers
     External representation:
          In algebraic notation: `REALPART+IMAGPARTi'. Of course, if
          IMAGPART is negative, its printed representation begins with
          a `-', and the `+' between REALPART and IMAGPART may be
          omitted. Note that this notation cannot be used when the
          IMAGPART is rational and the rational number's base is >18,
          because the `i' is then read as a digit.

          In Common Lisp notation: `#C(REALPART IMAGPART)'.

5.2 Input functions
===================

Including `<cln/io.h>' defines flexible input functions:

`cl_N read_complex (std::istream& stream, const cl_read_flags& flags)'
`cl_R read_real (std::istream& stream, const cl_read_flags& flags)'
`cl_F read_float (std::istream& stream, const cl_read_flags& flags)'
`cl_RA read_rational (std::istream& stream, const cl_read_flags& flags)'
`cl_I read_integer (std::istream& stream, const cl_read_flags& flags)'
     Reads a number from `stream'. The `flags' are parameters which
     affect the input syntax. Whitespace before the number is silently
     skipped.

`cl_N read_complex (const cl_read_flags& flags, const char * string, const char * string_limit, const char * * end_of_parse)'
`cl_R read_real (const cl_read_flags& flags, const char * string, const char * string_limit, const char * * end_of_parse)'
`cl_F read_float (const cl_read_flags& flags, const char * string, const char * string_limit, const char * * end_of_parse)'
`cl_RA read_rational (const cl_read_flags& flags, const char * string, const char * string_limit, const char * * end_of_parse)'
`cl_I read_integer (const cl_read_flags& flags, const char * string, const char * string_limit, const char * * end_of_parse)'
     Reads a number from a string in memory. The `flags' are parameters
     which affect the input syntax. The string starts at `string' and
     ends at `string_limit' (exclusive limit). `string_limit' may also
     be `NULL', denoting the entire string, i.e. equivalent to
     `string_limit = string + strlen(string)'. If `end_of_parse' is
     `NULL', the string in memory must contain exactly one number and
     nothing more, else an exception will be thrown. If `end_of_parse'
     is not `NULL', `*end_of_parse' will be assigned a pointer past the
     last parsed character (i.e. `string_limit' if nothing came after
     the number). Whitespace is not allowed.

The structure `cl_read_flags' contains the following fields:

`cl_read_syntax_t syntax'
     The possible results of the read operation. Possible values are
     `syntax_number', `syntax_real', `syntax_rational',
     `syntax_integer', `syntax_float', `syntax_sfloat',
     `syntax_ffloat', `syntax_dfloat', `syntax_lfloat'.

`cl_read_lsyntax_t lsyntax'
     Specifies the language-dependent syntax variant for the read
     operation.  Possible values are

    `lsyntax_standard'
          accept standard algebraic notation only, no complex numbers,

    `lsyntax_algebraic'
          accept the algebraic notation `X+Yi' for complex numbers,

    `lsyntax_commonlisp'
          accept the `#b', `#o', `#x' syntaxes for binary, octal,
          hexadecimal numbers, `#BASER' for rational numbers in a given
          base, `#c(REALPART IMAGPART)' for complex numbers,

    `lsyntax_all'
          accept all of these extensions.

`unsigned int rational_base'
     The base in which rational numbers are read.

`float_format_t float_flags.default_float_format'
     The float format used when reading floats with exponent marker `e'.

`float_format_t float_flags.default_lfloat_format'
     The float format used when reading floats with exponent marker `l'.

`bool float_flags.mantissa_dependent_float_format'
     When this flag is true, floats specified with more digits than
     corresponding to the exponent marker they contain, but without
     _NNN suffix, will get a precision corresponding to their number of
     significant digits.

5.3 Output functions
====================

Including `<cln/io.h>' defines a number of simple output functions that
write to `std::ostream&':

`void fprintchar (std::ostream& stream, char c)'
     Prints the character `x' literally on the `stream'.

`void fprint (std::ostream& stream, const char * string)'
     Prints the `string' literally on the `stream'.

`void fprintdecimal (std::ostream& stream, int x)'
`void fprintdecimal (std::ostream& stream, const cl_I& x)'
     Prints the integer `x' in decimal on the `stream'.

`void fprintbinary (std::ostream& stream, const cl_I& x)'
     Prints the integer `x' in binary (base 2, without prefix) on the
     `stream'.

`void fprintoctal (std::ostream& stream, const cl_I& x)'
     Prints the integer `x' in octal (base 8, without prefix) on the
     `stream'.

`void fprinthexadecimal (std::ostream& stream, const cl_I& x)'
     Prints the integer `x' in hexadecimal (base 16, without prefix) on
     the `stream'.

Each of the classes `cl_N', `cl_R', `cl_RA', `cl_I', `cl_F', `cl_SF',
`cl_FF', `cl_DF', `cl_LF' defines, in `<cln/TYPE_io.h>', the following
output functions:

`void fprint (std::ostream& stream, const TYPE& x)'
`std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& stream, const TYPE& x)'
     Prints the number `x' on the `stream'. The output may depend on
     the global printer settings in the variable `default_print_flags'.
     The `ostream' flags and settings (flags, width and locale) are
     ignored.

The most flexible output function, defined in `<cln/TYPE_io.h>', are
the following:
     void print_complex  (std::ostream& stream, const cl_print_flags& flags,
                          const cl_N& z);
     void print_real     (std::ostream& stream, const cl_print_flags& flags,
                          const cl_R& z);
     void print_float    (std::ostream& stream, const cl_print_flags& flags,
                          const cl_F& z);
     void print_rational (std::ostream& stream, const cl_print_flags& flags,
                          const cl_RA& z);
     void print_integer  (std::ostream& stream, const cl_print_flags& flags,
                          const cl_I& z);
Prints the number `x' on the `stream'. The `flags' are parameters which
affect the output.

The structure type `cl_print_flags' contains the following fields:

`unsigned int rational_base'
     The base in which rational numbers are printed. Default is `10'.

`bool rational_readably'
     If this flag is true, rational numbers are printed with radix
     specifiers in Common Lisp syntax (`#NR' or `#b' or `#o' or `#x'
     prefixes, trailing dot). Default is false.

`bool float_readably'
     If this flag is true, type specific exponent markers have
     precedence over 'E'.  Default is false.

`float_format_t default_float_format'
     Floating point numbers of this format will be printed using the
     'E' exponent marker. Default is `float_format_ffloat'.

`bool complex_readably'
     If this flag is true, complex numbers will be printed using the
     Common Lisp syntax `#C(REALPART IMAGPART)'. Default is false.

`cl_string univpoly_varname'
     Univariate polynomials with no explicit indeterminate name will be
     printed using this variable name. Default is `"x"'.

The global variable `default_print_flags' contains the default values,
used by the function `fprint'.

6 Rings
*******

CLN has a class of abstract rings.

                              Ring
                            cl_ring
                          <cln/ring.h>

Rings can be compared for equality:

`bool operator== (const cl_ring&, const cl_ring&)'
`bool operator!= (const cl_ring&, const cl_ring&)'
     These compare two rings for equality.

Given a ring `R', the following members can be used.

`void R->fprint (std::ostream& stream, const cl_ring_element& x)'
`bool R->equal (const cl_ring_element& x, const cl_ring_element& y)'
`cl_ring_element R->zero ()'
`bool R->zerop (const cl_ring_element& x)'
`cl_ring_element R->plus (const cl_ring_element& x, const cl_ring_element& y)'
`cl_ring_element R->minus (const cl_ring_element& x, const cl_ring_element& y)'
`cl_ring_element R->uminus (const cl_ring_element& x)'
`cl_ring_element R->one ()'
`cl_ring_element R->canonhom (const cl_I& x)'
`cl_ring_element R->mul (const cl_ring_element& x, const cl_ring_element& y)'
`cl_ring_element R->square (const cl_ring_element& x)'
`cl_ring_element R->expt_pos (const cl_ring_element& x, const cl_I& y)'

The following rings are built-in.

`cl_null_ring cl_0_ring'
     The null ring, containing only zero.

`cl_complex_ring cl_C_ring'
     The ring of complex numbers. This corresponds to the type `cl_N'.

`cl_real_ring cl_R_ring'
     The ring of real numbers. This corresponds to the type `cl_R'.

`cl_rational_ring cl_RA_ring'
     The ring of rational numbers. This corresponds to the type `cl_RA'.

`cl_integer_ring cl_I_ring'
     The ring of integers. This corresponds to the type `cl_I'.

Type tests can be performed for any of `cl_C_ring', `cl_R_ring',
`cl_RA_ring', `cl_I_ring':

`bool instanceof (const cl_number& x, const cl_number_ring& R)'
     Tests whether the given number is an element of the number ring R.

7.1 Modular integer rings
=========================

CLN implements modular integers, i.e. integers modulo a fixed integer N.
The modulus is explicitly part of every modular integer. CLN doesn't
allow you to (accidentally) mix elements of different modular rings,
e.g. `(3 mod 4) + (2 mod 5)' will result in a runtime error.  (Ideally
one would imagine a generic data type `cl_MI(N)', but C++ doesn't have
generic types. So one has to live with runtime checks.)

The class of modular integer rings is

                              Ring
                            cl_ring
                          <cln/ring.h>
                               |
                               |
                      Modular integer ring
                         cl_modint_ring
                       <cln/modinteger.h>

and the class of all modular integers (elements of modular integer
rings) is

                         Modular integer
                              cl_MI
                        <cln/modinteger.h>

Modular integer rings are constructed using the function

`cl_modint_ring find_modint_ring (const cl_I& N)'
     This function returns the modular ring `Z/NZ'. It takes care of
     finding out about special cases of `N', like powers of two and odd
     numbers for which Montgomery multiplication will be a win, and
     precomputes any necessary auxiliary data for computing modulo `N'.
     There is a cache table of rings, indexed by `N' (or, more
     precisely, by `abs(N)'). This ensures that the precomputation
     costs are reduced to a minimum.

Modular integer rings can be compared for equality:

`bool operator== (const cl_modint_ring&, const cl_modint_ring&)'
`bool operator!= (const cl_modint_ring&, const cl_modint_ring&)'
     These compare two modular integer rings for equality. Two
     different calls to `find_modint_ring' with the same argument
     necessarily return the same ring because it is memoized in the
     cache table.

7.2 Functions on modular integers
=================================

Given a modular integer ring `R', the following members can be used.

`cl_I R->modulus'
     This is the ring's modulus, normalized to be nonnegative: `abs(N)'.

`cl_MI R->zero()'
     This returns `0 mod N'.

`cl_MI R->one()'
     This returns `1 mod N'.

`cl_MI R->canonhom (const cl_I& x)'
     This returns `x mod N'.

`cl_I R->retract (const cl_MI& x)'
     This is a partial inverse function to `R->canonhom'. It returns the
     standard representative (`>=0', `<N') of `x'.

`cl_MI R->random(random_state& randomstate)'
`cl_MI R->random()'
     This returns a random integer modulo `N'.

The following operations are defined on modular integers.

`cl_modint_ring x.ring ()'
     Returns the ring to which the modular integer `x' belongs.

`cl_MI operator+ (const cl_MI&, const cl_MI&)'
     Returns the sum of two modular integers. One of the arguments may
     also be a plain integer.

`cl_MI operator- (const cl_MI&, const cl_MI&)'
     Returns the difference of two modular integers. One of the
     arguments may also be a plain integer.

`cl_MI operator- (const cl_MI&)'
     Returns the negative of a modular integer.

`cl_MI operator* (const cl_MI&, const cl_MI&)'
     Returns the product of two modular integers. One of the arguments
     may also be a plain integer.

`cl_MI square (const cl_MI&)'
     Returns the square of a modular integer.

`cl_MI recip (const cl_MI& x)'
     Returns the reciprocal `x^-1' of a modular integer `x'. `x' must
     be coprime to the modulus, otherwise an error message is issued.

`cl_MI div (const cl_MI& x, const cl_MI& y)'
     Returns the quotient `x*y^-1' of two modular integers `x', `y'.
     `y' must be coprime to the modulus, otherwise an error message is
     issued.

`cl_MI expt_pos (const cl_MI& x, const cl_I& y)'
     `y' must be > 0. Returns `x^y'.

`cl_MI expt (const cl_MI& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Returns `x^y'. If `y' is negative, `x' must be coprime to the
     modulus, else an error message is issued.

`cl_MI operator<< (const cl_MI& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Returns `x*2^y'.

`cl_MI operator>> (const cl_MI& x, const cl_I& y)'
     Returns `x*2^-y'. When `y' is positive, the modulus must be odd,
     or an error message is issued.

`bool operator== (const cl_MI&, const cl_MI&)'
`bool operator!= (const cl_MI&, const cl_MI&)'
     Compares two modular integers, belonging to the same modular
     integer ring, for equality.

`bool zerop (const cl_MI& x)'
     Returns true if `x' is `0 mod N'.

The following output functions are defined (see also the chapter on
input/output).

`void fprint (std::ostream& stream, const cl_MI& x)'
`std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& stream, const cl_MI& x)'
     Prints the modular integer `x' on the `stream'. The output may
     depend on the global printer settings in the variable
     `default_print_flags'.

8 Symbolic data types
*********************

CLN implements two symbolic (non-numeric) data types: strings and
symbols.

* Menu:

* Strings::
* Symbols::


File: cln.info,  Node: Strings,  Next: Symbols,  Up: Symbolic data types

8.1 Strings
===========

The class

                           String
                          cl_string
                        <cln/string.h>

implements immutable strings.

Strings are constructed through the following constructors:

`cl_string (const char * s)'
     Returns an immutable copy of the (zero-terminated) C string `s'.

`cl_string (const char * ptr, unsigned long len)'
     Returns an immutable copy of the `len' characters at `ptr[0]',
     ..., `ptr[len-1]'. NUL characters are allowed.

The following functions are available on strings:

`operator ='
     Assignment from `cl_string' and `const char *'.

`s.size()'
`strlen(s)'
     Returns the length of the string `s'.

`s[i]'
     Returns the `i'th character of the string `s'.  `i' must be in the
     range `0 <= i < s.size()'.

`bool equal (const cl_string& s1, const cl_string& s2)'
     Compares two strings for equality. One of the arguments may also
     be a plain `const char *'.


File: cln.info,  Node: Symbols,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Symbolic data types

8.2 Symbols
===========

Symbols are uniquified strings: all symbols with the same name are
shared.  This means that comparison of two symbols is fast (effectively
just a pointer comparison), whereas comparison of two strings must in
the worst case walk both strings until their end.  Symbols are used,
for example, as tags for properties, as names of variables in
polynomial rings, etc.

Symbols are constructed through the following constructor:

`cl_symbol (const cl_string& s)'
     Looks up or creates a new symbol with a given name.

The following operations are available on symbols:

`cl_string (const cl_symbol& sym)'
     Conversion to `cl_string': Returns the string which names the
     symbol `sym'.

`bool equal (const cl_symbol& sym1, const cl_symbol& sym2)'
     Compares two symbols for equality. This is very fast.

9.1 Univariate polynomial rings
===============================

CLN implements univariate polynomials (polynomials in one variable)
over an arbitrary ring. The indeterminate variable may be either
unnamed (and will be printed according to
`default_print_flags.univpoly_varname', which defaults to `x') or carry
a given name. The base ring and the indeterminate are explicitly part
of every polynomial. CLN doesn't allow you to (accidentally) mix
elements of different polynomial rings, e.g.  `(a^2+1) * (b^3-1)' will
result in a runtime error. (Ideally this should return a multivariate
polynomial, but they are not yet implemented in CLN.)

Univariate polynomial rings are constructed using the functions

`cl_univpoly_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_ring& R)'
`cl_univpoly_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_ring& R, const cl_symbol& varname)'
     This function returns the polynomial ring `R[X]', unnamed or named.
     `R' may be an arbitrary ring. This function takes care of finding
     out about special cases of `R', such as the rings of complex
     numbers, real numbers, rational numbers, integers, or modular
     integer rings.  There is a cache table of rings, indexed by `R'
     and `varname'.  This ensures that two calls of this function with
     the same arguments will return the same polynomial ring.

`cl_univpoly_complex_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_complex_ring& R)'
`cl_univpoly_complex_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_complex_ring& R, const cl_symbol& varname)'
`cl_univpoly_real_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_real_ring& R)'
`cl_univpoly_real_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_real_ring& R, const cl_symbol& varname)'
`cl_univpoly_rational_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_rational_ring& R)'
`cl_univpoly_rational_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_rational_ring& R, const cl_symbol& varname)'
`cl_univpoly_integer_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_integer_ring& R)'
`cl_univpoly_integer_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_integer_ring& R, const cl_symbol& varname)'
`cl_univpoly_modint_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_modint_ring& R)'
`cl_univpoly_modint_ring find_univpoly_ring (const cl_modint_ring& R, const cl_symbol& varname)'
     These functions are equivalent to the general `find_univpoly_ring',
     only the return type is more specific, according to the base
     ring's type.

9.2 Functions on univariate polynomials
=======================================

Given a univariate polynomial ring `R', the following members can be
used.

`cl_ring R->basering()'
     This returns the base ring, as passed to `find_univpoly_ring'.

`cl_UP R->zero()'
     This returns `0 in R', a polynomial of degree -1.

`cl_UP R->one()'
     This returns `1 in R', a polynomial of degree == 0.

`cl_UP R->canonhom (const cl_I& x)'
     This returns `x in R', a polynomial of degree <= 0.

`cl_UP R->monomial (const cl_ring_element& x, uintL e)'
     This returns a sparse polynomial: `x * X^e', where `X' is the
     indeterminate.

`cl_UP R->create (sintL degree)'
     Creates a new polynomial with a given degree. The zero polynomial
     has degree `-1'. After creating the polynomial, you should put in
     the coefficients, using the `set_coeff' member function, and then
     call the `finalize' member function.

The following are the only destructive operations on univariate
polynomials.

`void set_coeff (cl_UP& x, uintL index, const cl_ring_element& y)'
     This changes the coefficient of `X^index' in `x' to be `y'.  After
     changing a polynomial and before applying any "normal" operation
     on it, you should call its `finalize' member function.

`void finalize (cl_UP& x)'
     This function marks the endpoint of destructive modifications of a
     polynomial.  It normalizes the internal representation so that
     subsequent computations have less overhead. Doing normal
     computations on unnormalized polynomials may produce wrong results
     or crash the program.

The following operations are defined on univariate polynomials.

`cl_univpoly_ring x.ring ()'
     Returns the ring to which the univariate polynomial `x' belongs.

`cl_UP operator+ (const cl_UP&, const cl_UP&)'
     Returns the sum of two univariate polynomials.

`cl_UP operator- (const cl_UP&, const cl_UP&)'
     Returns the difference of two univariate polynomials.

`cl_UP operator- (const cl_UP&)'
     Returns the negative of a univariate polynomial.

`cl_UP operator* (const cl_UP&, const cl_UP&)'
     Returns the product of two univariate polynomials. One of the
     arguments may also be a plain integer or an element of the base
     ring.

`cl_UP square (const cl_UP&)'
     Returns the square of a univariate polynomial.

`cl_UP expt_pos (const cl_UP& x, const cl_I& y)'
     `y' must be > 0. Returns `x^y'.

`bool operator== (const cl_UP&, const cl_UP&)'
`bool operator!= (const cl_UP&, const cl_UP&)'
     Compares two univariate polynomials, belonging to the same
     univariate polynomial ring, for equality.

`bool zerop (const cl_UP& x)'
     Returns true if `x' is `0 in R'.

`sintL degree (const cl_UP& x)'
     Returns the degree of the polynomial. The zero polynomial has
     degree `-1'.

`sintL ldegree (const cl_UP& x)'
     Returns the low degree of the polynomial. This is the degree of
     the first non-vanishing polynomial coefficient. The zero
     polynomial has ldegree `-1'.

`cl_ring_element coeff (const cl_UP& x, uintL index)'
     Returns the coefficient of `X^index' in the polynomial `x'.

`cl_ring_element x (const cl_ring_element& y)'
     Evaluation: If `x' is a polynomial and `y' belongs to the base
     ring, then `x(y)' returns the value of the substitution of `y' into
     `x'.

`cl_UP deriv (const cl_UP& x)'
     Returns the derivative of the polynomial `x' with respect to the
     indeterminate `X'.

The following output functions are defined (see also the chapter on
input/output).

`void fprint (std::ostream& stream, const cl_UP& x)'
`std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& stream, const cl_UP& x)'
     Prints the univariate polynomial `x' on the `stream'. The output
     may depend on the global printer settings in the variable
     `default_print_flags'.

9.3 Special polynomials
=======================

The following functions return special polynomials.

`cl_UP_I tschebychev (sintL n)'
     Returns the n-th Chebyshev polynomial (n >= 0).

`cl_UP_I hermite (sintL n)'
     Returns the n-th Hermite polynomial (n >= 0).

`cl_UP_RA legendre (sintL n)'
     Returns the n-th Legendre polynomial (n >= 0).

`cl_UP_I laguerre (sintL n)'
     Returns the n-th Laguerre polynomial (n >= 0).

Information how to derive the differential equation satisfied by each
of these polynomials from their definition can be found in the
`doc/polynomial/' directory.

* Speed efficiency::
* Garbage collection::


File: cln.info,  Node: Why C++ ?,  Next: Memory efficiency,  Up: Internals

10.1 Why C++ ?
==============

Using C++ as an implementation language provides

   * Efficiency: It compiles to machine code.

   * Portability: It runs on all platforms supporting a C++ compiler.
     Because of the availability of GNU C++, this includes all
     currently used 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, independently of the
     quality of the vendor's C++ compiler.

   * Type safety: The C++ compilers knows about the number types and
     complains if, for example, you try to assign a float to an integer
     variable. However, a drawback is that C++ doesn't know about
     generic types, hence a restriction like that `operator+ (const
     cl_MI&, const cl_MI&)' requires that both arguments belong to the
     same modular ring cannot be expressed as a compile-time
     information.

   * Algebraic syntax: The elementary operations `+', `-', `*', `=',
     `==', ... can be used in infix notation, which is more convenient
     than Lisp notation `(+ x y)' or C notation `add(x,y,&z)'.

With these language features, there is no need for two separate
languages, one for the implementation of the library and one in which
the library's users can program. This means that a prototype
implementation of an algorithm can be integrated into the library
immediately after it has been tested and debugged. No need to rewrite
it in a low-level language after having prototyped in a high-level
language.


File: cln.info,  Node: Memory efficiency,  Next: Speed efficiency,  Prev: Why C++ ?,  Up: Internals

10.2 Memory efficiency
======================

In order to save memory allocations, CLN implements:

   * Object sharing: An operation like `x+0' returns `x' without copying
     it.

   * Garbage collection: A reference counting mechanism makes sure that
     any number object's storage is freed immediately when the last
     reference to the object is gone.

   * Small integers are represented as immediate values instead of
     pointers to heap allocated storage. This means that integers `>=
     -2^29', `< 2^29' don't consume heap memory, unless they were
     explicitly allocated on the heap.


File: cln.info,  Node: Speed efficiency,  Next: Garbage collection,  Prev: Memory efficiency,  Up: Internals

10.3 Speed efficiency
=====================

Speed efficiency is obtained by the combination of the following tricks
and algorithms:

   * Small integers, being represented as immediate values, don't
     require memory access, just a couple of instructions for each
     elementary operation.

   * The kernel of CLN has been written in assembly language for some
     CPUs (`i386', `m68k', `sparc', `mips', `arm').

   * On all CPUs, CLN may be configured to use the superefficient
     low-level routines from GNU GMP version 3.

   * For large numbers, CLN uses, instead of the standard `O(N^2)'
     algorithm, the Karatsuba multiplication, which is an `O(N^1.6)'
     algorithm.

   * For very large numbers (more than 12000 decimal digits), CLN uses
     Schoenhage-Strassen multiplication, which is an asymptotically
     optimal multiplication algorithm.

   * These fast multiplication algorithms also give improvements in the
     speed of division and radix conversion.


File: cln.info,  Node: Garbage collection,  Prev: Speed efficiency,  Up: Internals

10.4 Garbage collection
=======================

All the number classes are reference count classes: They only contain a
pointer to an object in the heap. Upon construction, assignment and
destruction of number objects, only the objects' reference count are
manipulated.

Memory occupied by number objects are automatically reclaimed as soon as
their reference count drops to zero.

For number rings, another strategy is implemented: There is a cache of,
for example, the modular integer rings. A modular integer ring is
destroyed only if its reference count dropped to zero and the cache is
about to be resized. The effect of this strategy is that recently used
rings remain cached, whereas undue memory consumption through cached
rings is avoided.

11 Using the library
********************

For the following discussion, we will assume that you have installed
the CLN source in `$CLN_DIR' and built it in `$CLN_TARGETDIR'.  For
example, for me it's `CLN_DIR="$HOME/cln"' and
`CLN_TARGETDIR="$HOME/cln/linuxelf"'. You might define these as
environment variables, or directly substitute the appropriate values.

* Compiler options::
* Include files::
* An Example::

* Reporting Problems::


File: cln.info,  Node: Compiler options,  Next: Include files,  Up: Using the library

11.1 Compiler options
=====================

Until you have installed CLN in a public place, the following options
are needed:

When you compile CLN application code, add the flags
        -I$CLN_DIR/include -I$CLN_TARGETDIR/include
to the C++ compiler's command line (`make' variable CFLAGS or CXXFLAGS).
When you link CLN application code to form an executable, add the flags
        $CLN_TARGETDIR/src/libcln.a
to the C/C++ compiler's command line (`make' variable LIBS).

If you did a `make install', the include files are installed in a
public directory (normally `/usr/local/include'), hence you don't need
special flags for compiling. The library has been installed to a public
directory as well (normally `/usr/local/lib'), hence when linking a CLN
application it is sufficient to give the flag `-lcln'.

To make the creation of software packages that use CLN easier, the
`pkg-config' utility can be used.  CLN provides all the necessary
metainformation in a file called `cln.pc' (installed in
`/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig' by default).  A program using CLN can be
compiled and linked using (1)
     g++ `pkg-config --libs cln` `pkg-config --cflags cln` prog.cc -o prog

Software using GNU autoconf can check for CLN with the
`PKG_CHECK_MODULES' macro supplied with `pkg-config'.
     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CLN], [cln >= MIN-VERSION])
This will check for CLN version at least MIN-VERSION.  If the required
version was found, the variables CLN_CFLAGS and CLN_LIBS are set.
Otherwise the configure script aborts.  If this is not the desired
behaviour, use the following code instead (2)
     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([CLN], [cln >= MIN-VERSION], [],
      [AC_MSG_WARNING([No suitable version of CLN can be found])])

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) If you installed CLN to non-standard location PREFIX, you need to
set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH' environment variable to PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
for this to work.

(2) See the `pkg-config' documentation for more details.

11.3 An Example
===============

A function which computes the nth Fibonacci number can be written as
follows.  

     #include <cln/integer.h>
     #include <cln/real.h>
     using namespace cln;

     // Returns F_n, computed as the nearest integer to
     // ((1+sqrt(5))/2)^n/sqrt(5). Assume n>=0.
     const cl_I fibonacci (int n)
     {
             // Need a precision of ((1+sqrt(5))/2)^-n.
             float_format_t prec = float_format((int)(0.208987641*n+5));
             cl_R sqrt5 = sqrt(cl_float(5,prec));
             cl_R phi = (1+sqrt5)/2;
             return round1( expt(phi,n)/sqrt5 );
     }

Let's explain what is going on in detail.

The include file `<cln/integer.h>' is necessary because the type `cl_I'
is used in the function, and the include file `<cln/real.h>' is needed
for the type `cl_R' and the floating point number functions.  The order
of the include files does not matter.  In order not to write out
`cln::'FOO in this simple example we can safely import the whole
namespace `cln'.

Then comes the function declaration. The argument is an `int', the
result an integer. The return type is defined as `const cl_I', not
simply `cl_I', because that allows the compiler to detect typos like
`fibonacci(n) = 100'. It would be possible to declare the return type
as `const cl_R' (real number) or even `const cl_N' (complex number). We
use the most specialized possible return type because functions which
call `fibonacci' will be able to profit from the compiler's type
analysis: Adding two integers is slightly more efficient than adding the
same objects declared as complex numbers, because it needs less type
dispatch. Also, when linking to CLN as a non-shared library, this
minimizes the size of the resulting executable program.

The result will be computed as expt(phi,n)/sqrt(5), rounded to the
nearest integer. In order to get a correct result, the absolute error
should be less than 1/2, i.e. the relative error should be less than
sqrt(5)/(2*expt(phi,n)).  To this end, the first line computes a
floating point precision for sqrt(5) and phi.

Then sqrt(5) is computed by first converting the integer 5 to a
floating point number and than taking the square root. The converse,
first taking the square root of 5, and then converting to the desired
precision, would not work in CLN: The square root would be computed to
a default precision (normally single-float precision), and the
following conversion could not help about the lacking accuracy. This is
because CLN is not a symbolic computer algebra system and does not
represent sqrt(5) in a non-numeric way.

The type `cl_R' for sqrt5 and, in the following line, phi is the only
possible choice. You cannot write `cl_F' because the C++ compiler can
only infer that `cl_float(5,prec)' is a real number. You cannot write
`cl_N' because a `round1' does not exist for general complex numbers.

When the function returns, all the local variables in the function are
automatically reclaimed (garbage collected). Only the result survives
and gets passed to the caller.

The file `fibonacci.cc' in the subdirectory `examples' contains this
implementation together with an even faster algorithm.

11.4 Debugging support
======================

When debugging a CLN application with GNU `gdb', two facilities are
available from the library:

   * The library does type checks, range checks, consistency checks at
     many places. When one of these fails, an exception of a type
     derived from `runtime_exception' is thrown. When an exception is
     cought, the stack has already been unwound, so it is may not be
     possible to tell at which point the exception was thrown. For
     debugging, it is best to set up a catchpoint at the event of
     throwning a C++ exception:
          (gdb) catch throw
     When this catchpoint is hit, look at the stack's backtrace:
          (gdb) where
     When control over the type of exception is required, it may be
     possible to set a breakpoint at the `g++' runtime library function
     `__raise_exception'. Refer to the documentation of GNU `gdb' for
     details.

   * The debugger's normal `print' command doesn't know about CLN's
     types and therefore prints mostly useless hexadecimal addresses.
     CLN offers a function `cl_print', callable from the debugger, for
     printing number objects. In order to get this function, you have
     to define the macro `CL_DEBUG' and then include all the header
     files for which you want `cl_print' debugging support. For example: 
          #define CL_DEBUG
          #include <cln/string.h>
     Now, if you have in your program a variable `cl_string s', and
     inspect it under `gdb', the output may look like this:
          (gdb) print s
          $7 = {<cl_gcpointer> = { = {pointer = 0x8055b60, heappointer = 0x8055b60,
            word = 134568800}}, }
          (gdb) call cl_print(s)
          (cl_string) ""
          $8 = 134568800
     Note that the output of `cl_print' goes to the program's error
     output, not to gdb's standard output.

     Note, however, that the above facility does not work with all CLN
     types, only with number objects and similar. Therefore CLN offers
     a member function `debug_print()' on all CLN types. The same macro
     `CL_DEBUG' is needed for this member function to be implemented.
     Under `gdb', you call it like this: 
          (gdb) print s
          $7 = {<cl_gcpointer> = { = {pointer = 0x8055b60, heappointer = 0x8055b60,
            word = 134568800}}, }
          (gdb) call s.debug_print()
          (cl_string) ""
          (gdb) define cprint
          >call ($1).debug_print()
          >end
          (gdb) cprint s
          (cl_string) ""
     Unfortunately, this feature does not seem to work under all
     circumstances.

11.5 Reporting Problems
=======================

If you encounter any problem, please don't hesitate to send a detailed
bugreport to the `cln-list@ginac.de' mailing list. Please think about
your bug: consider including a short description of your operating
system and compilation environment with corresponding version numbers. A
description of your configuration options may also be helpful. Also, a
short test program together with the output you get and the output you
expect will help us to reproduce it quickly. Finally, do not forget to
report the version number of CLN.

12.1 Error handling
===================

CLN signals abnormal situations by throwning exceptions. All exceptions
thrown by the library are of type `runtime_exception' or of a derived
type. Class `cln::runtime_exception' in turn is derived from the C++
standard library class `std::runtime_error' and inherits the `.what()'
member function that can be used to query details about the cause of
error.

The most important classes thrown by the library are

                       Exception base class
                         runtime_exception
                         <cln/exception.h>
                                 |
                +----------------+----------------+
                |                                 |
      Malformed number input             Floating-point error
      read_number_exception            floating_poing_exception
        <cln/number_io.h>                   <cln/float.h>

CLN has many more exception classes that allow for more fine-grained
control but I refrain from documenting them all here. They are all
declared in the public header files and they are all subclasses of the
above exceptions, so catching those you are always on the safe side.


File: cln.info,  Node: Floating-point underflow,  Next: Customizing I/O,  Prev: Error handling,  Up: Customizing

12.2 Floating-point underflow
=============================

Floating point underflow denotes the situation when a floating-point
number is to be created which is so close to `0' that its exponent is
too low to be represented internally. By default, this causes the
exception `floating_point_underflow_exception' (subclass of
`floating_point_exception') to be thrown. If you set the global variable
     bool cl_inhibit_floating_point_underflow
to `true', the exception will be inhibited, and a floating-point zero
will be generated instead.  The default value of
`cl_inhibit_floating_point_underflow' is `false'.

12.3 Customizing I/O
====================

The output of the function `fprint' may be customized by changing the
value of the global variable `default_print_flags'.  


File: cln.info,  Node: Customizing the memory allocator,  Prev: Customizing I/O,  Up: Customizing

12.4 Customizing the memory allocator
=====================================

Every memory allocation of CLN is done through the function pointer
`malloc_hook'. Freeing of this memory is done through the function
pointer `free_hook'. The default versions of these functions, provided
in the library, call `malloc' and `free' and check the `malloc' result
against `NULL'.  If you want to provide another memory allocator, you
need to define the variables `malloc_hook' and `free_hook' yourself,
like this:
     #include <cln/malloc.h>
     namespace cln {
             void* (*malloc_hook) (size_t size) = ...;
             void (*free_hook) (void* ptr)      = ...;
     }
The `cl_malloc_hook' function must not return a `NULL' pointer.

It is not possible to change the memory allocator at runtime, because
it is already called at program startup by the constructors of some
global variables.
