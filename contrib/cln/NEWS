=========================

Implementation changes

Other changes
-------------

2008-01-19, version 1.2.0
=========================

Algorithmic changes
-------------------

* Save big amounts of memory in computation of some functions and constants by:
    - Avoiding pre-computation of series terms and instead computing them in a
      streamed way.
    - Avoiding computation with excess precision in binary splitting algorithm
      by coercion of intermediate integer values to floating-point as early as
      possible.

Implementation changes
----------------------

* Added support for huge numbers:
    - intC used for all counter loops.
    - intE is now a 64-bit type on all 64-bit platforms and even on selected
      32-bit platforms.

* CLN now uses C++ exceptions for error handling. The cl_abort() hook is not
  supported any more. Please refer to the documentation to learn about existing
  exception types.

* Fixed a bug on i386 where comparing Z/2Z ring zeros returnd random results.

* Removed cl_boolean. Use built-in C++ bool instead.

  using this needs to be recompiled.

  float/double easier.

-------------

2004-11-03, version 1.1.9
=========================

Algorithmic changes

  complexity as opposed to O(N^2). Useful for all kinds of persistency.

Implementation changes
----------------------

* Fixed several bugs in the integer input and output routines that could be
  blamed for random crashes in the following cases: output in base 32 for
  quite large numbers, input in base 2 for fixnums and input in base 3 for
  fixnums on a 64 bit target.

=========================

Implementation changes
----------------------

* Minor cleanups for GCC 3.0 and libstdc++-v3.

* Fixes several little bugs and portability issues.


2000-12-14, version 1.1.0
=========================

Functional changes
------------------

* ISO/IEC 14882 fashion adjustments:
  Put everything into namespace cln.  All fundamental data types still
  carry their old names.  Other non-macro identifiers are now written as 
  cln::foo instead of cl_foo, except where the cl_ comes from a data type
  (as in cl_I_to_int()).  Headers are installed into a separate
  directory, #include <cln/foo.h> instead of <cl_foo.h>.  Applications
  must be manually ported to the new style.  We apologize for the
  inconvenience.

Implementation changes
----------------------

* Removed internal copy of mpn subdirectory tree from libgmp-2.0.2.
  Configuring with --with-gmp now relies on an installed libgmp library
  version 3 or above.  We recommend libgmp-3.1 or newer.

* Adjusted several break-even points to make better use of a faster libgmp and
  better match present-day CPUs.

* Fix several errors for architectures with 64-bit wide words.
  (Others than Alpha, which worked already.)

  (in file cln.m4).

* Fix an endless loop when either of the functions
  `cl_boolean rootp (const cl_RA&, uintL, cl_RA*)',
  `cl_boolean rootp (const cl_RA&, const cl_I&, cl_RA*)'
  was called with an integer argument. Thanks to Richard Kreckel.

  cause unnormalized rational numbers like 3/1 to be created.


1999-06-09, version 1.0.1
=========================

Algorithmic changes

    <cl_complex_io.h>
  The file <cl_io.h> now contains only I/O functions for characters and
  C integers.

* To access the base ring of a univariate polynomial ring, now use
  `R->basering()' instead of `R->basering'.

  cl_LF, cl_RA, cl_I.

  now normalizes the resulting u and v to be of minimum absolute value.
  (Suggested by the LiDIA group.)

* The conversion from string to cl_F, cl_R, cl_N now chooses the format of
  the resulting float depending on the number of significant digits present
  in the input string.

* Speed up the functions
  `cl_R operator* (const cl_RA&, const cl_LF&)'
  `cl_R operator* (const cl_LF&, const cl_RA&)'
  `cl_R operator/ (const cl_RA&, const cl_LF&)'
  `cl_LF operator/ (const cl_LF&, const cl_RA&)'

Implementation changes
----------------------

* Fix for `cl_I ash (const cl_I& x, const cl_I& n)' when |n| is between
  2^29 and 2^37.
  (Reported by Thomas Papanikolaou.)

* Fixed a memory leak in the long-float truncate function.
  (Reported by Keith Briggs.)

* Fixed a memory leak in the modular integer exponentiation.

* Reduced the stack space consumption. The default stack size (typically
  8 MB on Unix) should now be sufficient in order to run all CLN programs.

* Portability fixes for m68k platforms.

Other changes
-------------

* Restructured the sources. The subpackages
    - base

  caused a core dump.

* CLN's word sequences can be chosen to be stored big-endian in memory

==========

Functional changes
------------------
