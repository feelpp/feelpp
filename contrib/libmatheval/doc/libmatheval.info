1 Introduction
**************

GNU `libmatheval' is library comprising several procedures that makes
possible to create in-memory tree representation of mathematical
functions over single or multiple variables and later use this
representation to evaluate function for specified variable values, to
create corresponding tree for function derivative over specified
variable or to get back textual representation of in-memory tree.

   This section discuss use of programming interface exposed by library
from C programs. Readers interested in Fortran interface should switch
immediately to *note Fortran interface:: section.

   In order to use GNU `libmatheval' library from C code, it is
necessary first to include header file `matheval.h' from all files
calling GNU `libmatheval' procedures and then refer to `libmatheval'
library among other linker option.  Thus, command to compile C program
using library and stored in file `example.c' using GNU C compiler would
look like (supposing that library is installed using default prefix
`/usr/local/lib'):

     gcc example.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -lmatheval -o example

   Alternatively, `pkg-config' metadata file for `libmatheval' is
installed along with the library too, thus on system with `pkg-config'
installed following command could be used instead:

     gcc example.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs) -o example

   First step in actually utilizing library after including appropriate
header file would be to declare variable of `void *' type to point to
evaluator object that will represent given mathematical function:

     void *f;

   Then, given that textual representation of function is stored into
string `buffer', evaluator object corresponding to given mathematical
function could be created using `evaluator_create' procedure (see *note
evaluator_create::) as follows (see documentation for this procedure
also for description of notation that should be used to describe
mathematical functions):

     f = evaluator_create (buffer);
     assert (f);

   Return value should be always checked, because above procedure will
return null pointer if there exist syntax errors in notation.  After
that, one could utilize `evaluator_get_variables' (see *note
evaluator_get_variables::) procedure to obtain a list of variable names
appearing in function:

     {
       char **names;
       int count;
       int i;

       evaluator_get_variables (f, &names, &count);
       for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
         printf ("%s ", names[i]);
       printf ("\n");
     }

   Procedure `evaluator_evaluate' (see *note evaluator_evaluate::)
could be used to evaluate function for specific variable values.  Say
that above function is over variable "x" only, then following code will
evaluate and print function value for x = 0.1:

     {
       char *names[] = { "x" };
       double values[] = { 0.1 };

       printf ("f(0.1) = %g\n", evaluator_evaluate (f, 1, names,
                                                    values));
     }

   Or alternatively, since function is over variable with standard name
"x", convenience procedure `evaluator_evaluate_x' (*note
evaluator_evaluate_x::) could be used to accomplish same by following:

     printf ("f(0.1) = %g\n", evaluator_evaluate_x (f, 0.1));

   Evaluator object for function derivative over some variable could be
created from evaluator object for given function.  In order to
accomplish this, a declaration for derivative evaluator object should
be added to variable declarations section:

     void *f_prim;

   After that (supposing that "x" is used as derivation variable),
derivative evaluator object could be created using
`evaluator_derivative' procedure (see *note evaluator_derivative::):

     f_prim = evaluator_derivative (f, "x");

   or alternatively using `evaluator_derivative_x' convenience
procedure (see *note evaluator_derivative_x::):

     f_prim = evaluator_derivative_x (f);

   Derivative evaluator object could be used to evaluate derivative
values or say textual representation of derivative could be written to
standard output through utilizing `evaluator_get_string' procedure (see
*note evaluator_get_string::) to get string representing given
evaluator.  Following code would accomplish this:

     printf ("  f'(x) = %s\n", evaluator_get_string (f_prim));

   All evaluator objects must be destroyed after finished with using
them and `evaluator_destroy' procedure (see *note evaluator_destroy::)
is intended for this:

     evaluator_destroy (f);
     evaluator_destroy (f_prim);

   Here follows complete program connecting above fragments.  Program
read from standard input string representing function over variable
"x", create evaluators for function and its first derivative, print
textual representation of function derivative to standard output, then
read value of variable "x" and finally print to standard output values
of function and its first derivative for given value of variable "x".

          probably use GNU readline() instead of fgets() to overcome this
          limit.  */
       printf ("f(x) = ");
       fgets (buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, stdin);
       length = strlen (buffer);
       if (length > 0 && buffer[length - 1] == '\n')
         buffer[length - 1] = '\0';

       /* Create evaluator for function.  */
       f = evaluator_create (buffer);
       assert (f);

       /* Print variable names appearing in function. */
       evaluator_get_variables (f, &names, &count);
       printf ("  ");
       for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
         printf ("%s ", names[i]);
       printf ("\n");

       /* Create evaluator for function derivative and print textual
          representation of derivative.  */
       f_prim = evaluator_derivative_x (f);
       printf ("  f'(x) = %s\n", evaluator_get_string (f_prim));

       /* Read variable x value.  */
       printf ("x = ");
       scanf ("%lf", &x);

       /* Calculate and print values of function and its derivative for given
          value of x.  */
       printf ("  f(%g) = %g\n", x, evaluator_evaluate_x (f, x));
       printf ("  f'(%g) = %g\n", x, evaluator_evaluate_x (f_prim, x));

       /* Destroy evaluators.  */
       evaluator_destroy (f);
       evaluator_destroy (f_prim);

       exit (EXIT_SUCCESS);

------------------------

Synopsis
........

     #include <matheval.h>

     void *evaluator_create (char *string);

Description
...........

Create evaluator object from `string' containing mathematical
representation of function.  Evaluator object could be used later to
evaluate function for specific variable values or to calculate function
derivative over some variable.

   String representation of function is allowed to consist of decimal
numbers, constants, variables, elementary functions, unary and binary
operations.

1 / pi (`1_pi'), 2 / pi (`2_pi'), 2 / sqrt(pi) (`2_sqrtpi'), sqrt(2)
(`sqrt') and sqrt(1 / 2) (`sqrt1_2').

   Variable name is any combination of alphanumericals and `_'
characters beginning with a non-digit that is not elementary function
name.

   Supported elementary functions are (names that should be used are
given in parenthesis): exponential (`exp'), logarithmic (`log'), square
root (`sqrt'), sine (`sin'), cosine (`cos'), tangent (`tan'), cotangent
(`cot'), secant (`sec'), cosecant (`csc'), inverse sine (`asin'),
inverse cosine (`acos'), inverse tangent (`atan'), inverse cotangent
(`acot'), inverse secant (`asec'), inverse cosecant (`acsc'),
hyperbolic sine (`sinh'), cosine (`cosh'), hyperbolic tangent (`tanh'),
hyperbolic cotangent (`coth'), hyperbolic secant (`sech'), hyperbolic
cosecant (`csch'), hyperbolic inverse sine (`asinh'), hyperbolic
inverse cosine (`acosh'), hyperbolic inverse tangent (`atanh'),
hyperbolic inverse cotangent (`acoth'), hyperbolic inverse secant
(`asech'), hyperbolic inverse cosecant (`acsch'), absolute value
(`abs'), Heaviside step function (`step') with value 1 defined for x =
0, Dirac delta function with infinity (`delta') and not-a-number
(`nandelta') values defined for x = 0, and error function (`erf').

   Supported unary operation is unary minus (`'-'').

   Supported binary operations are addition (`'+''), subtraction
(`'+''), multiplication (`'*''), division multiplication (`'/'') and
exponentiation (`'^'').

   Usual mathematical rules regarding operation precedence apply.
Parenthesis (`'('' and `')'') could be used to change priority order.

   Blanks and tab characters are allowed in string representing
function; newline characters must not appear in this string.

Return value
............

Pointer to evaluator object if operation successful, null pointer
otherwise.  Evaluator object is opaque, one should only use return
pointer to pass it to other functions from library.

3 Fortran interface
*******************

Fortran interface to GNU `libmatheval' library is very similar to C
interface; still, complete documentation from *note Reference:: is
reproduced here using Fortran terms in order to have Fortran programmer
not to mess with C terms that he may not understand.  Besides
documentation for all library exported procedures, an example Fortran
program of structure similar to sequence of code fragments presented
for C programmers in *note Introduction:: section as well as notes on
how to link library with Fortran programs are presented here.

   Since passing arguments between C and Fortran is not (yet)
standardized, Fortran interface of library applies only to GNU Fortran
77 compiler; but note that same interface is working fine for GNU
Fortran 95 compiler.  Requests to adapt interface to other Fortran
compilers are welcome (see section *note Bugs:: for contact
information), under condition that access to corresponding compiler is
provided.

3.3 Fortran sample program
==========================

Here follows sample program demonstrating use of library Fortran
interface.  Hopefully, comments throughout code will be enough for
Fortran programmer to get acquainted with library usage.  Basic
functioning of program is equivalent to code presented for C programmer
in *note Introduction:: sequence, except that textual representation of
function derivative is not printed to standard output and this is
avoided simply because of Fortran 77 ugly string handling.  Following
code is written in Fortran 77 with GNU Fortran 77 compiler extensions
(most notable of these certainly is free form of source code).

     ! Program is demonstrating use of GNU libmatheval library of procedures
     ! for evaluating mathematical functions.

       ! Read function.  Function has to be over variable x, or result may

3.4 Fortran build process
=========================

In order to be able to reference GNU `libmatheval' procedures from
Fortran code, declarations of procedures that will be used should be
repeated, like demonstrated by *note Fortran sample program:: (once
when interface upgraded to Fortran 90, modules and `use' statement will
be employed here).  Command for compilation Fortran program using
library and stored in file `example.f' using GNU Fortran 77 compiler
would look like (again supposing that library is installed using
default prefix `/usr/local/lib'):

     f77 example.f -ff90 -ffree-form -L/usr/local/lib -lmatheval -o example

4.1 Design notes
================

As usual with an open source project, ultimate reference for anyone
willing to hack on it is its source code.  Every effort is put to have
source code properly commented; having in mind that GNU `libmatheval'
is rather simple project, it is reasonable to expect that this would be
enough for anyone interested in project internals to get acquainted
with it.  Still, this section will briefly explain project design. See
*note Project structure:: section for description of where each
functionality is located in source code.

   Mathematical functions are represented as trees in computer memory.
There are five different nodes in such a tree: number, constants,
variables, functions, unary operations and binary operations.  Single
data structure is employed for tree nodes, while union is used over
what is different among them.  Numbers have unique value, unary and
binary operations have unique pointer(s) to their operand(s) node(s).
To represent constants, variables and functions, a symbol table is
employed; thus constants, variables and functions have unique pointers
to corresponding symbol table records (functions also have unique
pointer to their argument node).  All operations related to functions
(e.g. evaluation or derivative calculation) are implemented as
recursive operations on tree nodes.  There exist a node operation that
is not visible as external procedure and this is node simplification;
this operation is very important regarding overall efficiency of other
operations and is employed each time when new tree created.

   Symbol table is implemented as hash table, where each bucket has
linked list of records stored in it.  Records store information of
symbol name and type (variable or function), as well as some unique
information related to evaluation: variable records store temporary
variable value and function records store pointer to procedure used to
actually calculate function value during evaluation.  Hashing function
described in `A.V. Aho, R. Sethi, J.D. Ullman, "Compilers - Principle,
Techniques, and Tools", Addison-Wesley, 1986, pp 435-437' is used.
Symbol tables are reference counted objects, i.e. could be shared.

   Evaluator objects actually consists of function tree and reference to
symbol table.  Most of operations on evaluator objects are simply
delegated to function tree root node.

   For parsing strings representing mathematical functions, Lex and Yacc
are employed.  Scanner is creating symbol table records for variables,
while for constants and functions it is only looking up existing symbol
table records (before starting scanning, symbol table should be
populated with records for constants and functions recognized by
scanner).  Parser is responsible for building function tree
representation.

   Couple error reporting procedures, as well as replacements for
standard memory allocation routines are also present.  These are rather
standard for all GNU projects, so deserve no further discussion.
Further present in project are couple procedures for mathematical
functions not implemented by C standard library, like cotangent,
inverse cotangent and some hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions.

   Also present in project are stubs for Fortran code calling library.
These stubs uses knowledge of GNU Fortran 77 compiler calling
conventions, take parameters from Fortran 77 calls, eventually mangle
them to satisfy primary C library interface and call library procedures
to actually do the work, finally eventually mangling return values to
satisfy Fortran 77 calling conventions again.

   Most important thing to know before criticizing library design is
that it is intentionally left as simple as it could be.  Decision is now
that eventual library usage should direct its improvements.  Some
obvious and intended improvements if enough interest for library arise
are enumerated in *note Intended improvements:: section.  If having
further suggestions, pleas see *note Bugs:: sections for contact
information.


File: libmatheval.info,  Node: Project structure,  Next: Intended improvements,  Prev: Design notes,  Up: Hacking

4.2 Project structure
=====================

Interesting source files are mostly concentrated in `lib' subdirectory
of distribution.  Basic arrangement is rather standard for GNU
projects, thus scanner is in `scanner.l' file, parser in `parser.y',
error handling routines are in `error.c' and `error.h' files,
replacements for standard memory allocation routines are in `xmalloc.c'
and `xmalloc.h', additional mathematical functions are in `xmath.c' and
`xmath.c'.  Project specific files are: `node.h' and `node.c' files for
tree representing mathematical function data structures and procedures,
`symbol_table.c' and `symbol_table.h' for symbol table data structures
and procedures and finally `evaluator.c' and `matheval.h' for evaluator
object data structures and procedures (evaluator object data structure
is moved to `.c' file because `matheval.h' is public header file and
this data structure should be opaque).  Fortran interface is
implemented in `f77_interface.c' file.

   File `libmatheval.texi' under `doc' subdirectory of distribution
contains Texinfo source of project documentation (i.e. what you are
reading now).

   Subdirectory `tests' contains library test suite.  Kind of mixed
design is employed here - GNU autotest is used for test framework in
order to achieve more portability, while number of small Guile scripts
are performing tests.  File `matheval.c' in `tests' subdirectory
contains program extending Guile interpreter with GNU `libmatheval'
procedures.  Files with `.at' extension in same subdirectory in turn
consist of fragments of Guile code that this extended Guile interpreter
executes in order to conduct tests.  File `matheval.sh' is shell
wrapper for program contained in `matheval.c' file; this wrapper is
used by autotest during testing instead of original program.  Most
interesting aspect of code from `tests' subdirectory is certainly Guile
interface for library that is implemented in `matheval.c' file; anyone
intending to write more tests must before approaching this task become
familiar with this interface.


File: libmatheval.info,  Node: Intended improvements,  Prev: Project structure,  Up: Hacking

4.3 Intended improvements
=========================

As stated in *note Design notes:: section, GNU `libmatheval' is
designed with intention to be simple and understandable and to
eventually have its usage to govern improvements.  Thus, further work
will be primarily directed by user requests and of course, as usual
with open source projects, with amount of spare time of primary
developer (see *note Bugs:: for contact information).  However, there
exist several obvious improvements that I'm willing to work on
immediately if any interest of library arise and these are (in random
order) listed below:

   * Extend scanner to recognize more mathematical functions, to
     recognize alternative names for existing functions (e.g. to
     recognize both `tg' and `tan' as names for tangent function) and to
     recognize more constants.

   * Implement variable hash table length for symbol table.  As for now,
     hash table length is fixed to 211 that is reasonable for most
     cases, but it would certainly be more robust to have hash table to
     be constructed of length proportional say to length of string
     representing function.

   * Add more simplifications to function tree representation.  Only
     basic simplifications, mostly related to numbers subtrees
     consolidation and binary operations neutral elements are employed
     now.  More ambitious optimization, using commutative, associative
     and distributive rules for binary operations would be desirable.

   * Improve output when evaluator object is printed.  Presently,
     parenthesis are always used around operations, while using them
     when necessary to establish proper evaluation priority order only
     would give prettier output

   * Add more tests.  Basic functionality of library is exercised
     through existing test suite, but present number of tests is
     certainly far from enough.

   * Extend and improve error handling.  There are couple `assert's
     left in code that may be replaced with some other mechanism, also
     probably error handling of more error conditions should be added to
     library.

   * Add command line interface to library, i.e. write a program that
     will make possible to evaluate expression for given variable
     values where both specified in command line, as program arguments
     (for expressions without variables this program could be useful as
     a calculator).

   There exists also an improvement that is obvious and necessary but
because I'm not native speaker I'm unfortunately not able to accomplish
it anything more than I already tried:

   * Clean up English used in documentation.

6 Rationale and history
***********************

The library is developed as a back-end for "Numerical Analysis" course
taught during 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 school years at
Department of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.  Most numerical
libraries (library accompanying "Numerical Recipes" book most notably
example) are asking programmer to write corresponding C code when it
comes to evaluate mathematical functions.  It seemed to me that it
would be more appropriate (well, at least for above mentioned course)
to have library that will make possible to specify functions as strings
and then have them evaluated for given variable values, so I wrote
first version of library during November 1999.  Fortran interface is
added to the library later; during January 2001 interface for Pacific
Sierra VAST Fortran 90 translator was implemented and during September
2001 it was replaced by interface for Intel Fortran 90 compiler (1).
This library eventually went into rather stable state and was tested by
number of other programs implementing various numerical methods and
developed for the same course.

   After completing engagement with this course, I thought it may be
interesting for someone else to use this code and decided to make it
publicly available.  So, having some spare time during June 2002, I
re-wrote whole library in preparation for public release, now employing
simpler overall design and also using GNU auto-tools and what else was
necessary according to GNU guidelines.  The benefit is that final
product looks much better now (well, at least to me and at least at the
very moment of this writing), the drawback is that code is not
thoroughly tested again.  But certainly author would be more than happy
to further improve and maintain it.  Please see *note Bugs::, for
contact information.

   The library source code was hosted on Savannah
(`http://savannah.gnu.org/') since Septembar 2002.  In September 2003,
library officially became part of GNU project.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) That was in turn replaced by interface for GNU Fortran 77
compiler in order to meet requirement that no GNU project should
require use of non-free software

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------

  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

  If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
