Setting: 

Box [0,2]x[0,6]
Fluid density 1
Fluid viscosity 0.01

Disk of radius 0.125 in (1.4) -> the correct value is in their reference paper by Coquerelle-Cottet
Solid density 1.5
Gravity -980

The .csv file contains the curve "Present study" of figure 19. 
Our simulation can not handle collision, so we compare just the fall of the cylinder.
