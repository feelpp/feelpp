   \section feelpp0970 Feel++ Release 0.97.0
   release date mm-dd-yyyy

   \subsection changes0970 Changes

   - Massive reorganisation of headers and files
   - Propose an alternative handling of header file: rather than having
     everything in one header file, include only the necessary header files
     which reduce compilation times

   \subsection features0970 Features

   - Support for discontinuous galerkin as well as internal face
     integration in parallel (1D, 2D and 3D)
   - Support discontinuous integration over a range of element (a subset of
     faces), see https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/issues/227

   \section feelpp0960 Feel++ Release 0.96.0
   release date 01-02-2014

   \subsection changes0960 Changes

   - performance improvements in parallel computing: reduce collective
     operations, rewrite of some internals
   - improved Ginac(symbolic calculus) support
   - updated documentation to reflect Homebrew(MacOSX) support and the more
     stringent requirements on the compilers that g++ must be at least 4.6 and
     clang 3.2

   \subsection features0960 Features

   - Feel++ is now fully supported on Mac OS X systems >= 10.9 (Mavericks) using
     Homebrew and MacPorts
   - Feel++ supports creating sequential function spaces out of parallel meshes
   - Feel++ supports creating local interpolation operators in subdomains
   - Feel++ provides an implementation of the empirical interpolation method (eim)
   - Feel++ provides a new reduced basis framework that uses the eim as a
     central ingredient to obtain an affine decomposition

   \subsection issues0960 Noteworthy Issues

   \section feelpp0950 Feel++ Release 0.95.0
   release date 04-10-2013

   \subsection changes0950 Changes

   - reduce tremendously the memory footprint in parallel application especially for large meshes
   - number of files generated by Ginac in parallel applications, now only one .so is generated for each expression
   - various valgrind invalid read and write fixed
   - fix memory leak using PETSc when solver/preconditioner needed frequent updates

   \subsection features0950 Features

   - support up to PETSc 3.4.2
   - support up to SLEPc 3.4.2
   - support up to Boost 1.54
   - support up to Eigen 3.2
   - Correspondence table between gmsh and feel++ node numbering allowing to
     easily couple different codes for example a feel++ code and a matlab code
   - now the boundary elements set correspond to all elements sharing a
     sub-entity with the boundary (point edge or face ) and not only a face
     this affects \c boundaryelements and \c internalelements
   - Extend support for Lambda expressions in the variational formulation
     language, now more complex expressions are allowed with the lambda
     expression framework
   - Submeshes of elements and faces can be extracted now in parallel. For
     efficient localization/interpolation later, the relation with the parent
     mesh can be kept. This is completely done under the hood.
   - Support for basic memory logging from PETSc
   - Lots of simplified user interface changes all over the place with control
     enabled from the .cfg files
