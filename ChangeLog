   \subsection changes0930 Changes

   - Feel++ is now hosted on GitHub : https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp

   - major update of the feel++ online manual using Doxygen
   see [Feel++ Online Document](http://feelpp.github.io/feelpp/)


   \subsection features0930 Features

   - retrieving command line/config options
   \code
   option(_name="",_prefix="",_sub="").as<xxx>()
   // for example retrieve the option gmsh.hsize
   option(_name="gmsh.hsize").as<double>()
   \endcode
   - \c Environment::findFile(std::string) : look for a file in the list of
     directories known to Feel++ (current directory, previous directories stored
     via \c changeRepository(), and for .geo/.mshg files also \c localGeoRepository()
     and \c systemGeoRepository()
   - support for Boost 1.53
   - support for PETSc 3.4
   - support for loadleveler, slurm and ccc: automatic generation of scheduling scripts
   - new feel++ snes options
     - snes-{r,a,s}tol
     - snes-maxit
     - snes-ksp-rtol
     - ksp-maxit
     - ksp-{a,d}tol
   - Nonlinear solves with lambda function, see \ref bratu.cpp and \ref nonlinearpow.cpp
   - added \ref LoadMesh function that can load either a .geo or a .msh file
   see \ref StokesTutorial
   - support for Gmsh mesh file binary format use \c --gmsh.format=1 (binary)
   - in bi/linear forms,
     - no need for specifying the algebraic representation for bi/linear forms anymore
     \code
     auto a = form2( Xh, Xh ); auto l=form1(Xh)
     a.solve( _solution=u, _rhs=l);
     \endcode
     - support for +=
     \code
     auto a = form2( Xh, Xh ), at = form2( Xh, Xh); a += at (sum matrices)
     auto l = form1( Xh ), lt = form1( Xh ); l += lt (sum vectors)
     \endcode
     useful for example for time dependent and time independent terms handling.
   - The language now supports the following \ref Keywords
     - \c cross(u,v) (cross product)
     - \c eye<m,n>(), \c Id<m,n>() identity matrix (if non square, 1 on main diagonal, 0 elsewhere)

     \endcode
   - changed options for bdf: now use . to separate  bdf from rest of option in

    - update geotool to support markers for 1D meshes
