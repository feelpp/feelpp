== Releases

The latest release of {feelpp} is https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/releases/latest[here]
image:https://github-basic-badges.herokuapp.com/release/feelpp/feelpp.svg[link=https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/releases/latest]

{feelpp} has a DOI provided by Zenodo. Please use this to cite {feelpp} if you use it in a publication
image:https://zenodo.org/badge/4392591.svg["DOI",link=https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/4392591]

{feelpp} is split into three components:

feelpp:: library and tools
feelpp-toolboxes:: mono and multiphysics toolboxes (cfd, csm, heat transfer, fsi, heat and fluid, hdg(poisson and elasticity), thermo-electric and maxwell)
feelpp-mor:: model order reduction applications and tools

These components are built and delivered in two distribution channels: `stable` and `latest`.
The channels are currently available via Docker containers, Debian and Ubuntu packages.

stable:: Once a year, sometimes more, we make a release of {feelpp}  and it becomes the basis of the `stable` channel.
The channel is updated infrequently, only for a new release or a major bug.

latest:: {feelpp} has a very active development and changes are made everyday with the research done by http://www.cemosis.fr[Cemosis] and its collaborators.
Each commit in the main development branch triggers a new full build with more than 800 tests from unit test to full pde solves.

Instructions are available here to install {feelpp} : https://docs.feelpp.org/user/latest/install/index.html.

== Slack Discussion Forum

We encourage you to ask questions and discuss any aspects of the project on https://feelpp.slack.com[Slack].
New contributors are always welcome!

== Continuous Integration

{feelpp} maintains various branches.
At the core, the development model is greatly inspired by existing models out there.
The central repo holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime: `master` and `develop`

`master`::
Main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a _production-ready_ state.

`develop`::
Main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
Some would call this the “integration branch”. This is where any automatic nightly builds are built from.

`feature/*`::
Feature branches (or sometimes called topic branches) are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.
When starting development of a feature, the target release in which this feature will be incorporated may well be unknown at that point.
The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

== What is {feelpp}?

link:http://docs.feelpp.org[{feelpp}] is a {cpp} library for continuous or discontinuous Galerkin methods including finite element method(FEM), spectral element methods(SEM), reduced basis methods, discontinuous Galerkin methods (DG and HDG) in 1D 2D and 3D and in parallel.
The objectives of this framework are quite ambitious; ambitions which could be expressed in various ways such as :

 * the creation of a versatile mathematical kernel solving easily problems using different techniques thus allowing testing and comparing methods, e.g. cG versus dG,
 * the creation of a small and manageable library which shall nevertheless encompass a wide range of numerical methods and techniques,
 * build mathematical software that follows closely the mathematical abstractions associated with partial differential equations (PDE),
 * the creation of a library entirely in C++ allowing to create complex and typically multi-physics applications such as fluid-structure interaction or mass transport in haemodynamic.


== Features

 * 1D 2D and 3D (including high order) geometries and also lower topological dimension 1D(curve) in 2D and 3D or 2D(surface) in 3D
 * continuous and discontinuous (dG and hdG) arbitrary order Galerkin Methods in 1D, 2D and 3D including finite and spectral element methods
 * domain specific embedded language in C++ for variational formulations
 * interfaced with link:http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/[PETSc] for linear and non-linear solvers
 * seamless parallel computations using PETSc
 * interfaced with link:http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/[SLEPc] for large-scale sparse standard and generalized eigenvalue  solvers
 * supports link:http://www.geuz.org/gmsh[Gmsh] for mesh generation
 * supports link:http://www.geuz.org/gmsh[Gmsh] for post-processing (including on high order geometries)
 * supports link:http://www.paraview.org[Paraview] and CEI/Ensight for post-processing and the following file formats: ensight gold, gmsh, xdmf.
