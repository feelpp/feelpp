/* WARNING : Please read the following lines
 *
 * In this program, we make the assumption that the end user wishes to
 * call a function (aka NumericalMathFunction) named "wcode" (wcode stands
 * for wrapped code).
 * In order to individualize the wrapper to the user's needs, we encourage
 * you (as the developer of this wrapper) to rename any occurence of "wcode"
 * (in either case) to the real name of the function.
 * It will also avoid any confusion with other "wcode"s written by other entities
 * or developers.
 */


/* If you want to customize this wrapper to your needs, you have to do the following :
 *  - change the current wrapper name 'wcode' to any name you chooze in the #define WRAPPERNAME macro.
 *  - adapt the signatures of the calls. You have to write it yourself in this file or in another one and
 *        link the wrapper with the corresponding object file. But you should normally have nothing more to do.
 *  - call your C function in the execute function of your wrapper.

   * with. If many wrappers are working simultaneously or if the same wrapper is called concurrently,
   * this mechanism will avoid any collision or confusion.
   * The consequence is that NO STATIC DATA should be used in the wrapper OR THE WRAPPER WILL BREAKE
   * one day. You may think that you can't do without static data, but in general this is the case
   * of a poor design. But if you persist to use static data, do your work correctly and make use
   * of mutex (for instance) to protect your data against concurrent access. But don't complain about

   * The 'init_' function is only called once when the NumericalMathFunction object is created.
   * It allows the wrapper to set some internal state, read some external file, prepare the function
   * to run, etc.
   *
   * The 'exec_' function is intended to execute what the wrapper is done for: compute an mathematical
   * function or anything else. It takes the internal state pointer as its first argument, the input
   * NumericalPoint pointer as the second and the output NumericalPoint pointer as the third.
   *
   * The 'finalize_' function is only called once when the NumericalMathFunction object is destroyed.
   * It allows the wrapper to flush anything before unloading.

   * Only the 'exec_' function is mandatory because the other ones are automatically provided by the platform.
