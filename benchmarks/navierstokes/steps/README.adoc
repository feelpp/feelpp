=== Purpose

The following is taken from  link:http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/CriticalPathInitiative/SpotlightonCPIProjects/ucm149414.htm[Reference website] and references <<Stewart>>, <<passerini>>.

The purpose of this project is to determine how computational fluid dynamics can be effectively used to characterize fluid flow and to predict blood damage in medical devices. To address this complex issue, FDA has partnered with academia and industry under the Critical Path Initiative program to advance the application of CFD technology in the development and evaluation of medical devices.

=== Application

To execute the 3D FDA benchmark, run the following command
```
mpirun -np <np> feelpp_unsteady_fda_3D --config-file fda_3d.cfg
```

Parameters in the config file:
- Mesh File. It is strongly advised to generate the mesh file and its partitioning before executing the code
```
gmsh.filename=<mesh file>.msh
```

=== Configurations

We consider three flow regimes $Re_t=500, 2000, 3500$ as described in Table <<TableRe>>. For each flow regime we compute quantities of interest at various sections of the domain. These sections are given by Figure <<FDASections>>.

. The quantities of interest are
 - The axial component of the velocity stem:[u^{norm}_z] is normalized with respect to the average axial velocity at the inlet $\bar{u}_i$ :
\[
u^{\mathrm{norm}}_z = \frac{u_z}{\bar{u}_i} \text{ with } \bar{u}_i=\frac{Q}{\pi D_i^2/4}.
\]

The geometry was retrieved by extruding the 2D section  (see figure <<2Dsection>>) 4 times.

Regarding $Re_t=500$, we shall consider the meshes described in Table <<TableMeshesRe500>>.
