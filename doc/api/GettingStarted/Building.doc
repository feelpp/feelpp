\section Unis Unix : dependencies
In order to install \feel on Unix systems (other than Mac OS X, in you have a Macintosh, please go to \ref Mac), you have to install many dependencies
before. Those libraries and programs are necessary for the
compilation and installation of the \feel librairies.<br>
This is the list of all the librairies you must have installed on your
computer, and the \lstinline|*-dev| packages for some of them. <br>
Required packages :
\li g++ (4.7, 4.8) OR Clang (3.3, 3.4)
\li MPI : openmpi (preferred) or mpich
\li Boost >= 1.49
\li Petsc >= 3.2
\li Cmake >= 2.8.7
\li Gmsh >= 2.8.3 (can be found at <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gmsh">http://www.geuz.org/gmsh</a>)
\li Libxml2

Optional packages :
\li Superlu
\li Suitesparse(umfpack)
\li Metis: scoth with the metis interface (preferred), metis (non-free)
\li Google perftools
\li Paraview, this is not stricly required to run \feel programs but it is somehow
  necessary for visualisation. (can be found at <a href="http://www.paraview.org">http://www.paraview.org</a>)
\li Python (2.5 or later) for the validation tools

Note that all these packages are available under Debian/GNU/Linux and
Ubuntu. They should be available. Once you have installed those dependencies, you can jump to \ref Compiling.

\section DebianUbuntu Feel++ on Debian and Ubuntu
\subsection Debian Debian
Debian is the platform of choice for \feel, it was developed mainly on it. The commands to install \feel on Debian are
\verbatim
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install feel++-apps libfeel++-dev feel++-doc
\endverbatim

The interested user is encourage to follow the \feel PTS page
\li Feel++ <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/f/feel%2B%2B.html">Debian Packages Tracking System</a>

At the moment \feel compiles and is available on the following Debian
plateforms:
\li Feel++ <a href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=feel%2b%2b">Build results</a>

\subsection Ubuntu Ubuntu
\feel was uploaded in the distribution Ubuntu-Natty (11.04) for the first
time. The commands to install \feel on Ubuntu are
\bverbatim
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install feel++-apps libfeel-dev feel++-doc
\endverbatim
The interested user might want to follow the Ubuntu Launchpad \feel page in
order to know what is going on with \feel on Ubuntu

\section Mac Feel++ on Mac OS X
\feel is also supported on Mac operating systems, starting from OS X 10.9 Mavericks. The way to make it work is quite different.

\subsection Compilers Compilers
In order to make \feel and <tt>cmake</tt> work properly, you first have to install \lia Xcode for Gcc/clang. <br />
If your computer is recent, you can install it with your DVD that came with your machine (not the
OS DVD, but the applications one). You don't have to install the complete Xcode (you can uncheck iOS SDK for example,
it's not necessary here and requires a lot of memory). You can also install Xcode through the App Store.
Xcode will provide your computer all the basic tools to compile, such as gcc and clang.
It's the first step, you'll see later how to easily install the necessary tools to build \feel.

\subsection PMS Package management systems
Currently, building \feel is only available through <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. <a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">MacPorts</a> versions are also present in the source tree of \feel. You can find a version using gcc in &lt;path to top feel directory&gt;/ports/macosx/macports, and an experimental version using clang/libc++ in &lt;path to top feel directory&gt;/ports/macosx/macports-xc5.

\subsection Homebrew Homebrew
<b>Introduction</b> : Homebrew is a free/open source software introduced to simplify the installation of other free/open source softwares on the MacOS X ecosystem. It is distributed under the <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/LICENSE">BSD 2 Clause (NetBSD) license</a>. For more information, visit their <a href="http://brew.sh">website</a>.

<b>Installation</b> : To install the latest version of Homebrew, simply visit their <a href="http://brew.sh">website</a> and follow the instructions. Each new package Homebrew installs is built into an intermediate place called the Cellar (usually /usr/local/Cellar) and then the packages are symlinked into /usr/local (default).

<b>Key commands</b> : Homebrew base command is <tt>brew</tt>. Here is a list of useful commands to use Homebrew:
\li <tt>brew doctor</tt>: Check if the system has any problem with the current installation of brew,
\li <tt>brew install mypackage</tt>: This action installs the package mypackage,
\li <tt>brew install [--devel|--HEAD] mypackage</tt>: These action respectively installs either the development version or the HEAD version of the package mypackage, if such versions are specified in the Formula file,
\li <tt>brew uninstall mypackage</tt>: This action uninstalls the package mypackage.

<b>Formula</b> : A Formula is a <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> script describing to Homebrew how to install a package. \feel uses specific Formulae that you can get in the \feel github repository: <a href="https://github.com/feelpp/homebrew-science">feelpp/homebrew-science</a>.

\subsection HomebrewFeel Homebrew and Feel++
In order to build \feel from Homebrew, you have to do the following steps:
\verbatim
# Install Homebrew:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/feelpp/homebrew/go)"
# Check that everything is ok or fix warnings/errors if necessary:
brew doctor
# Get the Formulae specific to Feel++ on the github of feelpp:
brew tap feelpp/science
# Install Feel++:
brew install feelpp
\endverbatim

or in a more detailed way:
\verbatim
# Install Homebrew:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/feelpp/homebrew/go)"
# Check that everything is ok or fix warnings/errors if necessary:
brew doctor
# Get the Formulae specific to Feel++ on the github of feelpp:
brew tap feelpp/science
# Install openmpi with c++11 support:
brew install open-mpi --c++11
# Install boost:
brew install boost --without-python --without-single --without-static --with-mpi --c++11
# Install Ann, Petsc, Gmsh and HDF5:
brew install ann && brew install petsc && brew install gmsh && brew install hdf5
# Install Feel++:
brew install feelpp
\endverbatim

And you should be set to use \feel on MacOS X.

\subsection MacPorts MacPorts
<b>Introduction</b> : MacPorts is an open-source community projet which aims to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing and upgrading open-source softwares on Mac OS X operating system. It is distributed under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD License</a> and facilitate the access to thousands of ports (softwares) without installing or compiling open-source softwares.  MacPorts provides a single software tree which includes the latest stable releases of approximately 17700 ports targeting the current Mac OS X release (10.9). If you want more information, please visit their <a href="http://www.macports.org/">website</a>.

<b>Installation</b> : To install the latest version of MacPorts, please go to
<a href="http://www.macports.org/install.php">Installing MacPorts</a> page and follow the instructions. The simplest way is to install it with the Mac OS X Installer using the <tt>pkg</tt> file provided on their website. It is recommended that you install X11 (X Window System) which is normally used to display X11 applications.<br>
If you have installed with the package installer (<tt>MacPorts-2.x.x.pkg</tt>) that means MacPorts will be installed in <tt>/opt/local</tt>. From now on, we will suppose that macports has been installed in <tt>/opt/local</tt> which is the default MacPorts location. Note that from now on, all tools installed by MacPorts will be installed in <tt>/opt/local/bin</tt> or <tt>/opt/local/sbin</tt> for example (that's here you'll find gcc4.7 or later e.g <tt>/opt/local/bin/g++-mp-4.7</tt> once being installed).

<b>Key commands</b> : In your command-line, the software MacPorts is called by the command <tt>port</tt>. Here is a list of key commands for using MacPorts, if you want more informations please go to <a href="http://guide.macports.org/#using.port">MacPorts Commands</a>.
\li <tt>sudo port -v selfupdate</tt>: This action should be used regularly to update the local tree with the global MacPorts ports. The option <tt>-v</tt> enables verbose which generates verbose messages.
\li <tt>port info mypackage</tt>: This action is used to get information about a port (description, license, maintainer, etc.)
\li <tt>sudo port install mypackage</tt>: This action install the port mypackage
\li <tt>sudo port uninstall mypackage</tt>: This action uninstall the port mypackage
\li <tt>port installed</tt>: This action displays all ports installed and their versions, variants and activation status. You can also use the <tt>-v</tt> option to also display the platform and CPU architecture(s) for which the ports were built, and any variants which were explicitly negated.
\li <tt>sudo port upgrade mypackage</tt>: This action updgrades installed ports and their dependencies when a <tt>Portfile</tt> in the repository has been updated. To avoid the upgrade of a port's dependencies, use the option <tt>-n</tt>.

<b>Portfile</b> : A Portfile is a TCL script which usually contains simple keyword values and TCL expressions. Each package/port has a corresponding Portfile but it's only a part of a port description.  \feel provides some mandatory Portfiles for its compilation which are either not available in MacPorts or are buggy but \feel also provides some Portfiles which are already available in MacPorts such as
gmsh or petsc. They usually provide either some fixes to ensure \feel works
properly or new version not yet available in MacPorts.  These Portfiles are
installed in <tt>ports/macosx/macports</tt>.


\subsection MacPortsFeel MacPorts and Feel++
To be able to install \feel, add the following line in <tt>/opt/local/etc/macports/source.conf</tt> at the top of the file before any other sources :
\verbatim
file:///<path to feel top directory>/ports/macosx/macports
\endverbatim

Once it's done, type in a command-line :
\verbatim
  cd <your path to feel top directory>/ports/macosx/macports
  portindex -f
\endverbatim

You should have an output like this :
\verbatim
Reading port index in $<$your path to feel top directory$>$/ports/macosx/macports
Adding port science/feel++
Adding port science/gmsh
Adding port science/petsc

Total number of ports parsed:   3
Ports successfully parsed:      3
Ports failed:                   0
Up-to-date ports skipped:       0
\endverbatim

Your are now able to type
\verbatim
  sudo port install feel++
\endverbatim

It might take some time (possibly an entire day) to compile all the requirements for \feel to compile properly. If you have several cores on your MacBook Pro, iMac or MacBook we suggest that you configure macports to use all or some of them.
To do that uncomment the following line in the file  <tt>/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf</tt>
\verbatim
buildmakejobs	0 $\#$ all the cores
\endverbatim
At the end of the <tt>sudo port install feel++</tt>, you have all dependencies installed. To build all the Makefile, \cmake is automatically launched but can have some libraries may not be found but they are not mandatory for build Feel++, only the features related to the missing libraries will be missing.

\subsection Missing Missing ports
<tt>cmake</tt> can build Makefiles even if some packages are missing (latex2html, VTK ...). It's not necessary to install them but you can complete the installation
with MacPorts, <tt>cmake</tt> will find them by itself once they have been installed.

\subsection MacPortsXC5 MacPorts and XCode 5
There is an experimental version of ports for \feel in &lt;path to top feel directory&gt;/ports/macosx/macports-xc5. Using these ports will set up the compilation using clang and libc++. The process is similar to the one previously described for MacPorts, except for one point:
Before starting to install packages, you must switch to the llvm c++ standard library by adding the following line to your macports.conf file:
\verbatim
cxx_stdlib  libc++
\endverbatim
This requires MacPorts to be at least on version 2.2.1 for the flag to be recognized and will normally cause all the packages you will install to be recompiled using libc++ instead of libstdc++.

\section Compiling Compiling Feel++
Feel build system uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org"><tt>cmake</tt></a> as its build system. Check that \cmake is using gcc4.7 (or a higher version) or clang++ as C++ compiler (you can use the option <tt>CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<path>/g++-4.7</tt> where the <tt>path</tt> depends on your OS, it's probably <tt>/usr/bin</tt> or
<tt>/opt/local/bin</tt> but you can also change it with the command <tt>ccmake</tt>
and press <tt>t</tt> for advanced options).
\feel, using <tt>cmake</tt>, can be built either in source and out of source and different
build type:
\li minsizerel : minimal size release
\li release release
\li debug : debug
\li none(default)

<b>CMake Out Source Build (preferred)</b> : The best way is to have a directory (<tt>FEEL</tt> for example) in which you have :
\code
feel/
\endcode
where <tt>feel</tt> is the top directory where the source have been downloaded. Placed in <tt>FEEL</tt>, you can create the build directory <tt>feel.opt</tt> for example) and lauch cmake with :
\verbatim
  mkdir feel.opt
  cd feel.opt
  cmake <directory where the feel source are>
  # e.g cmake ../feel if feel.opt is at the same
  # directory level as feel
\endverbatim
you can customize the build type:
\verbatim
  # Choose g++ release
  cmake -CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++
  # Debug build type (-g...)
  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  # Release build type (-O3...)
  cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  ...
\endverbatim

<p>
<b>Per-system specific configuration</b>:
If you need to set specific CMake variables to fit an exotic system (e.g. supercomputer), you can create a machine file fitting this system.
To do so, simply create a file named <tt>feelpp.machines.&lt;name&gt;.cmake</tt> in the <tt>cmake/machines</tt> directory, where <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> is the machine name returned by the execution of <tt>uname -n</tt>.
The file will automatically be recognized and loaded, when you will be compiling \feel on this system.
</p>

Once Cmake has done its work, you are now able to compile the library with:
\verbatim
  make
\endverbatim
You can speed up the compilation process, if you have a multicore processor. To do so, you have to specify the number of parallel jobs <tt>make</tt> will be allowed to spawn by using the <tt>-j</tt> flag:
\verbatim
  make -j <nbjobs>
\endverbatim
<b>Important</b>: from now on, all commands should be typed in <tt>feel.opt</tt> or its subdirectories.

<p>
<b>Unit tests</b>:
\feel comes with built-in unit tests to ensure that the library is working correctly. You can launch basic tests based on the quickstart application by typing:
\verbatim
  make check
\endverbatim
Or you can execute the whole testsuite, by typing the following command: (This might take a while)
\verbatim
  make check-full
\endverbatim
</p>
