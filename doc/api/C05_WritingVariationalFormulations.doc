\section StandardFormulationLaplacian Standard formulation: the Laplacian case

\subsection MathematicalFormulation Mathematical formulation

In this example, we would like to solve for the following problem in 2D
find \f$u\f$ such that
\f[
  -\Delta u = f\ \text{in}\ \Omega = [-1;1]^2
\f]
with
\f[
  f= 2 \pi^2  g
\f]
and \f$g\f$ is the exact solution
\f[
  g=\sin(\pi x) \cos(\pi y)
\f]
The following boundary conditions apply
\f[
  u=g_{|x=\pm 1}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} = 0_{|y=\pm 1}
\f]

We propose here two possible variational formulations. The first one,
handles the Dirichlet boundary conditions strongly, that is to say the
condition is \emph{incorporated} into the function space definitions.
The second one handles the Dirichlet condition \emph{weakly} and hence
we have a uniform treatment for all types of boundary conditions.



\par Strong Dirichlet conditions

The variational formulation reads as follows, we introduce the spaces
\f[
  \mathcal{X} = \Big\{ v \in H_1(\Omega) \text{ such that } v=g_{|x=-1,x=1} \Big\}
\f]
and
\f[
  \mathcal{V} = \Big\{ v \in H_1(\Omega) \text{ such that } v=0_{|x=-1,x=1} \Big\}
\f]

We multiply (\ref{eq:1}) by \f$v \in \mathcal{V}\f$ then integrate over \f$\Omega\f$ and obtain
\f{equation}{
  \label{eq:13}
  \int_\Omega -\Delta u v = \int_\Omega f v
\f}
We integrate by parts and reformulate the problem as follows:
we look for \f$u \in \mathcal{X}\f$ such that for all \f$v \in \mathcal{V}\f$
\f[
  \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v  = \int_\Omega f v
\f]
In the present space setting~(\ref{eq:12}) and boundary
conditions~(\ref{eq:4}), we have the boundary term from the integration by
parts which is dropped being equal to 0
\f[
  \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v = 0,
\f]

recalling that

\f[
  \label{eq:21}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \nabla u \cdot n
\f]

where \f$n\f$ is the outward normal to \f$\partial \Omega\f$ by convention.We
now discretize the problem, we create a mesh out of \f$\Omega\f$, we have
\f[
  \label{eq:10}
  \Omega = \cup_{e=1}^\nel \Omega^e
\f]

where \f$\Omega^e\f$ can be segments, triangles or tetrahedra depending on
\f$d\f$ and we have \f$\nel\f$ of them. We introduce the finite dimensional
spaces of continuous piecewise polynomial of degree \f$N\f$ functions

\f[
  \label{eq:17}
  X_h = \Big\{ v_h  \in C^0(\Omega),\ {v_h}_{|\Omega^e} \in \mathbb{P}_N( \Omega^e ),\   v_h=g_{|x=-1,x=1}\Big\}
\f]

and

\f[
  \label{eq:18}
  V_h = \Big\{ v_h \in C^0(\Omega),\ {v_h}_{|\Omega^e} \in \mathbb{P}_N( \Omega^e ),\   v_h=0_{|x=-1,x=1}\Big\}
\f]

which are out trial and test function spaces respectively.  We now
have the problem we seek to solve which reads in our continuous
Galerkin framework

we look for \f$u_h \in X_h \subset \mathcal{X}\f$ such that for all \f$v \in V_h \subset \mathcal{V}\f$
\f[
\int_\Omega \nabla u_h \cdot \nabla v_h  = \int_\Omega f v_h
\f]

\par Weak Dirichlet conditions

There is an alternative formulation which allows to treat weakly
Dirichlet(Essential) boundary conditions similarly to Neumann(Natural)
and Robin conditions. Following a similar development as in the previous section, the problem reads

We look for \f$u \in X_h \subset H_1(\Omega)\f$ such that for all \f$v \in X_h\f$
\f[
  \int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v +
  \int_{|x=-1,x=1} -\frac{\partial u}{\partial n} v - u \frac{\partial v}{\partial n} + \frac{\mu}{h} u v
  =
  \int_\Omega f v +
  \int_{|x=-1,x=1}  - g \frac{\partial v}{\partial n} + \frac{\mu}{h} g v
\f]
where
\f[
  \label{eq:19}
  X_h = \Big\{ v_h \in C^0(\Omega),\ {v_h}_{|\Omega^e} \in \mathbb{P}_N( \Omega^e ) \Big\}
\f]

In (\ref{eq:16}), \f$g\f$ is defined by (\ref{eq:3}). \f$\mu\f$ serves as a penalisation
parameter which should be \f$> 0\f$, e.g. between 2 and 10, and \f$h\f$ is the
size of the face. The inconvenient of this formulation is the
introduction of the parameter \f$\mu\f$, but the advantage is the
\emph{weak} treatment of the Dirichlet condition.

\subsection FeelFormulation Feel formulation
\label{sec:feel-formulation-1}

First we define the \f$f\f$ and \f$g\f$. To do that we use the new C++
<tt>auto</tt> keyword and associate to <tt>f</tt> and
<tt>g</tt> their corresponding expressions

\dontinclude laplacian.cpp
\skip marker1
\until endmarker1


where <tt>M_PI</tt> is defined in the header
<tt>cmath</tt>.  Using <tt>auto</tt> allows to defined
<tt>f</tt>  and <tt>g</tt> --- which are moderately complex
object --- without having to know the actual type. <tt>auto</tt>
determines automatically the type of the expression using the
<tt>__typeof__</tt> keyword internally.

Then we form the right hand side by defining a linear form whose
algebraic representation will be stored in a
<tt>vector_ptrtype</tt> which is provided by the chosen linear
algebra backend. The linear form is equated with an integral
expression defining our right hand side.

\skip marker2
\until endmarker2

\noindent <tt>form1</tt> generates an instance of the object
representing linear forms, that is to say it mimics the mathematical
object \f$\ell\f$ such that
\f[
  \begin{array}{rccl}
    \ell: & X_h & \mapsto & \mathbb{R}\\
    & v_h & \rightarrow &\ell(v_h)=\int_\Omega f v_h
  \end{array}
\f]
which is represented algebraically in the code by the vector
<tt>F</tt> using the argument <tt>_vector</tt>. The last
argument <tt>_init</tt>, if set to <tt>true</tt>, will zero-out the entries of
the vector <tt>F</tt>.
\note \c _init is  set to <tt>false</tt> by default.


We now turn to the left hand side and define the bilinear form using
the <tt>form2</tt> helper function which is passed \e (i) the
trial function space using the <tt>_trial</tt> option,
\e (ii) the test function space using the <tt>_test</tt>
option, \e (iii) the algebraic representation using
<tt>_matrix</tt>, i.e. a sparse matrix whose type is derived from
one of the linear algebra backends and \e (iv) whether the
associated matrix should initialized using
<tt>_init</tt>.

\skip marker3
\until endmarker3

Finally, we deal with the boundary condition, we implement both
formulation described in appendix~\ref{sec:vari-form-1}. For a
\emph{strong} treatment of the Dirichlet condition, we use the
<tt>on()</tt> keyword of FEEL++ as follows

\skip marker5
\until endmarker5

Notice that we add, using <tt>+=</tt>, the Dirichlet contribution
for the bilinear form. The first argument is the set of boundary faces
to apply the condition: in gmsh the points satisfying \f$x=\pm 1\f$ are
marked using the flags \f$1\f$ and \f$3\f$ (\f$x=-1\f$ and \f$x=1\f$ respectively.)

To implement the weak Dirichlet boundary condition, we add the
following contributions to the left and right hand side:

\dontinclude laplacian.cpp
\skip marker41
\until endmarker41

\dontinclude laplacian.cpp
\skip marker10
\until endmarker10


Note that we use the command line option <tt>--weakdir</tt> set to
1 by default to decide between weak/strong Dirichlet handling.  Apart
the uniform treatment of boundary conditions, the weak Dirichlet
formulation has the advantage to work also in a parallel environment.

Next we solve the   linear   system
\anchor lapsystem
\f[
  D u = F
\f]

where the <tt>solve</tt> function is implemented as follows

\dontinclude laplacian.cpp
\skip marker6
\until endmarker6

Finally we check for the \f$L_2\f$ error in our approximation by computing
\f{equation}{
  \label{eq:7}
  \|u-u_h\|_{L_2}\ =\ \sqrt{\int_\Omega (u-u_h)^2} = \sqrt{\int_\Omega (g-u_h)^2}
\f}
where \f$u\f$ is the exact solution and is equal to \f$g\f$ and \f$u_h\f$ is the
numerical solution of the problem and the components of
\f$u_h\f$ in the \f$P_2\f$ Lagrange basis are given by solving the linear system \ref lapsystem "above".

The code reads

\dontinclude laplacian.cpp
\skip marker7
\until endmarker7


You can now verify that the \f$L_2\f$ error norm behaves like \f$h^{-(N+1)}\f$
where \f$h\f$ is the mesh size and \f$N\f$ the polynomial order. The \f$H_1\f$
error norm would be checked similarly in \f$h^{-N}\f$. The
figure~\ref{fig:2} displays the results using Paraview.

\section MixedFormulationStokesCase Mixed formulation: the Stokes case

We are now interested in solving
the Stokes equations, we would like to solve for the following problem
in 2D

find \f$(\mathbf{u},p)\f$ such that
\f{
  - \mu \Delta \mathbf{u} +\nabla p = \mathbf{f}\quad \text{and}\quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,\quad \text{in}\ \Omega = [-1;1]^2
\f}
with
\f{
  \label{eq:24}
  \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}
\f}
where \f$\mu\f$ being the viscosity. The following boundary conditions apply
\f{
  \label{eq:23}
  \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{1}_{|y=1}, \quad \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}_{|\partial \Omega \backslash \{(x,y) \in \Omega | y=1\}}
\f}

In problem (\ref{prob:2}), \f$p\f$ is known up to a constant \f$c\f$,
\emph{i.e.} if \f$p\f$ is a solution then \f$p+c\f$ is also solution. To
ensure uniqueness we impose the constraint that \f$p\f$ should have
zero-mean, \emph{i.e.}
\f[
  \label{eq:26}
  \int_\Omega p = 0
\f]

The problem~\ref{prob:4} now reads

Find \f$(\mathbf{u},p,\lambda)\f$ such that
\f[
  - \mu \Delta \mathbf{u} +\nabla p = \mathbf{f}\quad, \quad \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} + \lambda = 0, \quad \text{and}\quad \int_\Omega p = 0,\quad \text{in}\ \Omega = [-1;1]^2
\f]

with

\f[
  \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{0}
\f]
where \f$\mu\f$ being the viscosity. The following boundary conditions apply
\f[
  \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{1}_{|y=1}, \quad \mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}_{|\partial \Omega \backslash \{(x,y) \in \Omega | y=1\}}
\f]

The functional framework is as follows, we look for \f$\mathbf{u}\f$ is
\f$H^1_0(\Omega)\f$ and \f$p\f$ in \f$L^2_0(\Omega)\f$. We shall not seek \f$p\f$ in
\f$L^2_0(\Omega)\f$ but rather in \f$L^2(\Omega)\f$ and use Lagrange
multipliers which live are the constants whose space we denote
\f$\mathbb{P}_0(\Omega)\f$, to enforce~(\ref{eq:26}).

Denote \f$\mathcal{X} = H^1_0(\Omega)\times
L^2(\Omega)\times\mathbb{P}_0(\Omega)\f$, the variational formulation
reads we look for \f$(\mathbf{u}, p, \lambda) \in \mathcal{X}\f$ for all
\f$(\mathbf{v},q,\nu) \in \mathcal{X}\f$
\f[
  \int_\Omega \mu \nabla \mathbf{u} : \nabla \mathbf{v} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} p + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}\ q + q \lambda + p \nu  \ = \ \int_\Omega \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{v}
\f]

We build a triangulation \f$\Omega_h\f$ of \f$\Omega\f$, we choose compatible
(piecewise polynomial) discretisation spaces \f$X_h\f$ and \f$M_h\f$,
\emph{e.g.} the Taylor Hood element (\f$\mathbb{P}_N/\mathbb{P}_{N-1}\f$)
and we denote \f$\mathcal{X}_h=X_h\times M_h \times
\mathbb{P}_0(\Omega)\f$.  The discrete problem now reads, we look for
\f$(\mathbf{u}_h,p_h,\lambda_h) \in \mathcal{X}_h\f$ such that for all
\f$(\mathbf{v}_h,q_h,\nu_h) \in \mathcal{X}_h\f$
\f[
  \label{eq:27}
  \int_{\Omega_h} \mu \nabla \mathbf{u}_h \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v}_h + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_h \ p_h + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}_h\ q_h + p_h \nu_h + q_h \lambda_h   = \ \int_{\Omega_h} \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{v}_h
\f]

The formulation~(\ref{eq:27}) leads to a linear system of the form
\f[
  \label{eq:28}
  \underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    A & B & 0\\
    B^T & 0 & C\\
    0 & C^T & 0
  \end{pmatrix}}_{\mathcal{A}}
\underbrace{
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathbf{u}_h\\
    p_h\\
    \lambda_h
  \end{pmatrix}}_{\mathcal{U}} =
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}
    F\\
    0\\
    0
  \end{pmatrix}}_{\mathcal{F}}
\f]

where \f$A\f$ corresponds to the \f$(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\f$ block, \f$B\f$ to
the \f$(\mathbf{u},q)\f$ block and \f$C\f$ to the \f$(p,\nu)\f$
block. \f$\mathcal{A}\f$ is a symetric positive definite matrix and thus
the system \f$\mathcal{A} \mathcal{U} = \mathcal{F}\f$ enjoys a unique
solution.

\subsection FeelFormulation Feel formulation


Regarding the implementation of the Stokes problem~\ref{prob:4}, we
can start from the laplacian case, from
section~\ref{sec:defin-bilin-forms}. The implementation we choose to
display here defines and builds \f$\mathcal{X}_h\f$, \f$\mathcal{A}\f$,
\f$\mathcal{U}\f$ and \f$\mathcal{F}\f$.

We start by defining and building \f$\mathcal{X}_h\f$: first we define the
basis functions that will span each subspaces \f$X_h\f$, \f$M_h\f$ and
\f$\mathbb{P}_0(\Omega)\f$.

\dontinclude stokes.cpp
\skip marker1
\until endmarker1

note that on the <tt>typedef</tt> we build a (MPL) vector of them. Now we are
ready to define the functionspace \f$\mathcal{X}_h\f$, much like in the
Laplacian case:

\skip marker2
\until endmarker2

Next we define a few types which are associated with \f$\mathcal{U}\f$,
\f$u\f$, \f$p\f$ and \f$\lambda\f$ respectively.

\skip marker3
\until endmarker3

Using these types we can instantiate elements of \f$\mathcal{X}_h\f$,
\f$X_h\f$, \f$M_h\f$ and \f$\mathbb{P}_0(\Omega_h)\f$ respectively:

\skip marker4
\until endmarker4

They will serve in the definition of the variational formulation. We
can now start assemble the various terms of the variational
formulation~(\ref{eq:27}). First we define some viscous stress tensor,
%\f$\tau(\mathbf{u}) = \frac{1}{2}(\nabla \mathbf{u} + \nabla \mathbf{u}^T)\f$,
\f$\tau(\mathbf{u}) = \nabla \mathbf{u}\f$,
associated with the trial and test functions
respectively

\skip marker5
\until endmarker5


Then we define the total stress tensor times the normal,
\f$\bar{\sigma}(\mathbf{u},p) \mathbf{n} = -p \mathbf{n} + 2 \mu \tau(\mathbf{u})
\mathbf{n}\f$ where \f$\mathbf{n}\f$ is the normal and \f$\bar{\sigma}(\mathbf{u},p) =
-p \mathbb{I} + 2 \mu \tau(\mathbf{u})\f$:

\skip marker6
\until endmarker6


We then form the matrix \f$\mathcal{A}\f$ starting with block \f$A\f$,  block \f$B\f$
block \f$C\f$ and finally the boundary conditions.

\skip marker7
\until endmarker7
