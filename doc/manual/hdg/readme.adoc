= Mixed Poisson HDG Model

== Materials

The materials need to have the expression for the conductivity as a property. By default, this property is named `cond`, but it can be override with the option `conductivity_json`. +
If the problem is non linear, the materials also need to have the non linear conductivity expression. By default, this property is named `condNL`, but it can be override with the option `conductivityNL_json`.

== Boundary Conditions

The boundary conditions are on the fields `potential` or `flux`. +
On the potential, you can have:

- `SourceTerm`
- `Dirichlet`
- `Neumann`
- `Robin`

On the flux:

- `SourceTerm`
- `Integral`

== Advance usage

The constructor can take a string paramter, if not empty, this string is used as a prefix for all options.

The right hand side can be updated with `updatePotentialRHS` or `updateFluxRHS`, the former is to update $$\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u} = f$$ and the latter for $$\mathbf{u}+\sigma\nabla p = g$$. +
The term containing the conductivity $$(\mathbf{u}/\sigma, \mathbf{v})$$ can be updated with `updateConductivityTerm`. +
All these functions take an expression and a marker for parameters, if no marker is provided, the expression is applied on all the volume. The expression represents $$f$$, $$g$$ or $$\sigma$$. +
For the conductivity, the json file can be used instead by using the override function with a `bool` for parameter. If false, the conductivity will be set according to the option `conductivity_json`, if true, the conductivity will be set according to the option `conductivityNL_json`.

== Examples

The simpliest way to use it:

[source,c++]
----
auto MP = MixedPoisson<2,1>();
MP.init();
MP.solve();
MP.exportResults();
----

A more involved example:

[source,c++]
----
auto mesh = loadMesh(new mesh_type);
auto MP = MixedPoisson<3,2>("MyPrefix");
MP.init(mesh);
auto v = MP.potentialSpace()->element();
auto ex = cst(2.)*idv(v);
MP.updateConductivityTerm(ex);
MP.solveNL();
auto e = export(mesh);
e->add("myflux", MP.fluxField());
e->add("mypotential", MP.potentialField());
e->save();
----
