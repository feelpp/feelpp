== Introduction 

It is well known an equation can describe a huge range of physical
problems. Each of theses problems will have a particular environment, but the equation to solve will be the same. To make our program applicable to theses range of problem, we have defined a model. Models definitions can be retrieve in this link:../../QuickReference/Models/README.adoc[section].

== What is a model

A model is defined by :

- a Name

- a Description

- a Model

- Parameters

- Materials

- Boundary Conditions

- Post Processing

=== Parameters

A parameter is a non physical property for a model.

=== Materials

To retrieve the materials properties, we use :   

[source,c++]
----  
ModelMaterials materials = model.materials(); 
----  

=== BoundaryConditions

Thanks to GiNaC, we handle boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin) as expression. You have to indicate in the json file the quantity to handle (velocity, pressure...) and the associated expression.   

[source,c++]
----  
map_scalar_field<2> bc_u { model.boundaryConditions().getScalarFields<2>("heat","dirichlet") };
---- 

We can apply theses boundary condition this way

[source,c++]
----  
  for(auto it : bc_u){
    if(boption("myVerbose") && Environment::isMasterRank() )
      std::cout << "[BC] - Applying " << it.second << " on " << it.first << std::endl;
    a+=on(_range=markedfaces(mesh,it.first), _rhs=l, _element=u, _expr=it.second );
  }
----

=== Code

[source,c++]
----  
{% include "/Tutorial/10-Model/10-model1.cpp" %}
----

=== PostProcessing 

TODO: fill that part.

=== Example 

We have set up an example : an anisotropic laplacian. 

[source,c++]
----  
{% include "/Tutorial/10-Model/10-model2.cpp" %}
