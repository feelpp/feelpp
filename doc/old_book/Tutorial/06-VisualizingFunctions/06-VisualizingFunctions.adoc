The next step is to visualize function over the mesh. The source code that generate our output is available in link:code/05-myexporter.cpp[myexporter.cpp], presented in the previous section. 

== Reading saved data 

You can visualize data via :

- https://www.ceisoftware.com/[ensight]

- http://www.paraview.org/[paraview]

- http://geuz.org/gmsh[gmsh]

The results files are in 

- `$HOME/feel/myexporter/np_1` 

or

- `$FEELPP_WORKDIR/feel/myexporter/np_1`.

We discriminate output directories based on the name of the simulation (the parameter `_name` in the environment), the number of process (`mpirun -np ...`) and the type of the chosen exporter
(`--exporter.format={ensight|ensightgold|gmsh|...}`).
