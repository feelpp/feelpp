== Relaxation

Split into lower, diagonal, upper parts: $$ A = L + D + U $$.

=== Jacobi

Cheapest preconditioner: $$P^{-1}=D^{-1}$$.

=== Successive over-relaxation (SOR)

$$
\left(L + \frac 1 \omega D\right) x_{n+1} = \left[\left(\frac 1\omega-1\right)D - U\right] x_n + \omega b \\
P^{-1} = \text{$k$ iterations starting with $x_0=0$}\\
$$

* Implemented as a sweep.

* $$\omega = 1$$ corresponds to Gauss-Seidel.

* Very effective at removing high-frequency components of residual.


== Factorization

Two phases

   - symbolic factorization: find where fill occurs, only uses 
   sparsity pattern.
   
   - numeric factorization: compute factors.

=== LU decomposition

   - preconditioner.
   
   - Expensive, for $$m\times m$$ sparse matrix with bandwidth $$b$$, traditionally requires $$\mathcal{O}(mb^2)$$ time and $$\mathcal{O}(mb)$$ space.
   
    * Bandwidth scales as $$m^{\frac{d-1}{d}}$$ in $$d$$-dimensions.
    
    * Optimal in 2D: $$\mathcal{O}(m \cdot \log m)$$ space, $$\mathcal{O}(m^{3/2})$$ time.
    
    * Optimal in 3D: $$\mathcal{O}(m^{4/3})$$ space, $$\mathcal{O}(m^2)$$ time.
   
   - Symbolic factorization is problematic in parallel.

=== Incomplete LU

   - Allow a limited number of levels of fill: ILU($$k$$).
   
   - Only allow fill for entries that exceed threshold: ILUT.
   
   - Usually poor scaling in parallel.
   
   - No guarantees.

== 1-level Domain decomposition

   Domain size $$L$$, subdomain size $$H$$, element size $$h$$

 * Overlapping/Schwarz
    
    - Solve Dirichlet problems on overlapping subdomains.
    
    - No overlap: $$\textit{its} \in \mathcal{O}\big( \frac{L}{\sqrt{Hh}} \big)$$.
    
    - Overlap $$\delta$$: $$\textit{its} \in \big( \frac L {\sqrt{H\delta}} \big)$$.

 * Neumann-Neumann

    - Solve Neumann problems on non-overlapping subdomains.
    
    - $$\textit{its} \in \mathcal{O}\big( \frac{L}{H}(1+\log\frac H h) \big)$$.
    
    - Tricky null space issues (floating subdomains).
    
    - Need subdomain matrices, not globally assembled matrix.

> **Notes:** Multilevel variants knock off the leading $$\frac L H$$. +
Both overlapping and nonoverlapping with this bound.

 * BDDC and FETI-DP
    
     - Neumann problems on subdomains with coarse grid correction.
    
     - $$\textit{its} \in \mathcal{O}\big(1 + \log\frac H h \big)$$.


== Multigrid

=== Introduction

Hierarchy: Interpolation and restriction operators $$ \Pi^\uparrow : X_{\text{coarse}} \to X_{\text{fine}} \qquad \Pi^\downarrow :  X_{\text{fine}} \to X_{\text{coarse}} $$
   
   - Geometric: define problem on multiple levels, use grid to compute hierarchy.
   
   - Algebraic: define problem only on finest level, use matrix structure to build hierarchy.

Galerkin approximation

Assemble this matrix: $$A_{\text{coarse}} = \Pi^\downarrow A_{\text{fine}} \Pi^\uparrow$$

Application of multigrid preconditioner ($$ V $$-cycle)

- Apply pre-smoother on fine level (any preconditioner).

- Restrict residual to coarse level with $$\Pi^\downarrow$$.

- Solve on coarse level $$A_{\text{coarse}} x = r$$.

- Interpolate result back to fine level with $$\Pi^\uparrow$$.

- Apply post-smoother on fine level (any preconditioner).


=== Multigrid convergence properties

- Textbook: $$P^{-1}A$$ is spectrally equivalent to identity
    
    * Constant number of iterations to converge up to discretization error.

- Most theory applies to SPD systems
    
    * variable coefficients (e.g. discontinuous): low energy interpolants.
    
    * mesh- and/or physics-induced anisotropy: semi-coarsening/line smoothers.
    
    * complex geometry: difficult to have meaningful coarse levels.
    
- Deeper algorithmic difficulties

    * nonsymmetric (e.g. advection, shallow water, Euler).
    
    * indefinite (e.g. incompressible flow, Helmholtz).

- Performance considerations
   
    * Aggressive coarsening is critical in parallel.
    
    * Most theory uses SOR smoothers, ILU often more robust.
    
    * Coarsest level usually solved semi-redundantly with direct solver.

- Multilevel Schwarz is essentially the same with different language

    * assume strong smoothers, emphasize aggressive coarsening.
