Integration
===========

You should be able to create a mesh now. If it is not the case, get back to the section link:mesh.adoc[Mesh].

The prerequisite of this section is to be able to :

* link:Mesh/iterators.adoc[Iterate over a region of a mesh elements, faces, edges and points]

* link:keywords.adoc[Define expressions]

Then you can define and compute integrals

* link:Mesh/iterators.adoc[Define integration domain]

* link:Integrals/integrate.adoc[Compute integrals]

* link:Integrals/mean.adoc[Compute mean value of a function]

* link:Integrals/norms.adoc[Compute norms]
