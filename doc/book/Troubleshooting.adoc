==== My code runs slower on a server dedicated to computing than on my laptop with the same number of processes. What is the problem ?

You might experience drops in performance when scaling to a larger computer, for example from a laptop. The most common way to solve this is to export the following variable:

   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

This is due to an underlying library using the maximum number of available threads to execute a code. This causes drops in performance. When declaring the previous variable, you will only allow one thread per process, thus restoring expected performance.

Other factors that might harm performance:

* Slower hard drives
* Slower CPUs / Hyperthreading
