# Partitioning

In `feelpp/applications/mesh`, an application, named https://github.com/feelpp/feelpp/blob/develop/applications/mesh/mesh_partitioner.cpp[`feelpp_mesh_partitioner`], can generate a partitioned mesh and save it in a hdf5 file that can be loaded efficiently in parallel.

## Options

The partitioner executable need some options in order to supply our result files.

|===
| Name | Description | Default value
| `dim` | dimension of the mesh | 3
| `shape`| shape of the mesh elements | Simplex
| `part` | number of desired partitions | 
| `ifile` | name or path to the mesh | 
| `ofile` | output filename |
| `odir` | output directory | 
|===

## Code 

The code will partition a mesh, given by `ifile` option, into a number of partition equals to `part`. The result of this operation will then be exported in the Feel++  parallel format `json+hdf5`.
